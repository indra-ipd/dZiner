      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m['To design a peptide with lower hemolytic activity, consider the following guidelines based on amino acid sequence modifications:\\n\\n1. **Use of Non-Natural Amino Acids**: Incorporate non-natural amino acids such as azaproline (AzPro) to disrupt typical hydrogen bonding patterns and reduce membrane disruption.\\n\\n2. **Alternating Chirality**: Design peptides with alternating L and D amino acids to form heterochiral helical structures, which can reduce hemolytic activity by altering the interaction with cell membranes.\\n\\n3. **Hydrophobicity and Charge**: Adjust the hydrophobicity and charge distribution along the peptide sequence to minimize interactions with red blood cell membranes. This can involve reducing the number of hydrophobic residues or balancing them with hydrophilic ones.\\n\\n4. **Helical Stability**: Ensure the designed helices are stable in aqueous conditions but do not form stable channels in lipid bilayers, as channel formation can lead to cell lysis.\\n\\n5. **Peptide Length**: Optimize the length of the peptide to avoid excessive membrane disruption. Shorter peptides may have reduced hemolytic activity compared to longer ones.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can design peptides that maintain antibacterial properties while minimizing their hemolytic activity.', 'To design peptides with lower hemolytic activity, consider the following guidelines based on amino acid sequence modifications:\\n\\n1. **Avoid High Amphiphilicity**: While amphiphilicity is important for antimicrobial activity, excessive amphiphilicity can lead to hemolysis. Aim for a balanced hydrophobic moment.\\n\\n2. **Limit Cationic Residues**: Although cationic residues (like lysine and arginine) are crucial for antimicrobial activity, their overuse can increase hemolytic activity. Use them judiciously.\\n\\n3. **Incorporate Non-hemolytic Residues**: Include amino acids known to reduce hemolysis, such as proline and glycine, which can disrupt the formation of a stable helical structure that interacts with cell membranes.\\n\\n4. **Avoid Methionine**: Methionine residues have been associated with increased hemolytic activity. Exclude methionine from the sequence.\\n\\n5. **Optimize Sequence Length**: Keep the peptide length manageable (up to 15 residues) to facilitate synthesis and reduce the likelihood of hemolysis.\\n\\n6. **Use D-amino Acids Sparingly**: Due to their low representation in training sets and potential to form hemolytic peptides, avoid or limit the use of D-amino acids.\\n\\n7. **Ensure Novelty**: Design sequences that are sufficiently different (e.g., at least 5 mutations away) from known hemolytic peptides to ensure novelty and potentially lower hemolytic activity.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can design peptides that maintain antimicrobial efficacy while minimizing hemolytic activity.']\u001b[0m\n",
