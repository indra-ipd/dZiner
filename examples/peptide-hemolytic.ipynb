    "dZiner can work with different textual representation of materials, not just SMILES. In this example, I show how you can apply it design peptides with a lower hemolytic activity, given their sequence which contains the 20 essential amino acids (AA) in some order. The surrogate model in this case is a bi-directional LSTM that learns the distant-based dependency information between the AA residues within the sequence and map it to sequence's property. See [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01317) for more details on the model."

      "\n",
      "1. **Stabilize Helical Conformation**: Use analogs that stabilize the helical structure without promoting hemolysis. For example, incorporating lactam-bridged residues between specific amino acids can stabilize the helix while reducing hemolytic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Modify Side Chains**: Alter the side chains of amino acids to reduce interactions with red blood cell (RBC) membranes. This can involve using less hydrophobic or less positively charged residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reduce Antibacterial Activity**: Peptides with reduced antibacterial activity often show lower hemolytic activity. This can be achieved by modifying the sequence to disrupt the peptide's ability to form pores in bacterial membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Non-Standard Amino Acids**: Incorporate non-standard amino acids like azaproline (AzPro) to create a stable helical structure that does not favor membrane disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Certain Residues**: Minimize or avoid residues known to enhance membrane disruption, such as lysine and arginine, which are highly cationic and can interact strongly with the negatively charged components of RBC membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can design peptides that maintain their structural integrity while minimizing their potential to cause hemolysis. The design guidelines for making a peptide with lower hemolytic activity, based on changes to the amino acid residues within the sequence, include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Avoiding High Amphiphilicity**: Designing peptides with lower amphiphilicity can help reduce hemolytic activity. This involves balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues to avoid strong interactions with eukaryotic cell membranes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorporating Non-hemolytic Residues**: Using amino acids that are less likely to disrupt eukaryotic cell membranes, such as glycine, serine, and threonine, can help reduce hemolytic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reducing Positive Charge Density**: While antimicrobial peptides often have a high positive charge to interact with negatively charged bacterial membranes, reducing the density of positively charged residues (like lysine and arginine) can help minimize hemolysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sequence Novelty**: Ensuring that the peptide sequence is distinct from known hemolytic peptides by introducing mutations can help in reducing hemolytic activity. The study mentioned using sequences that were at least five mutations away from known peptides.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Secondary Structure Considerations**: Designing peptides that do not form strong amphiphilic α-helices, which are known to disrupt cell membranes, can help reduce hemolytic activity.\n",
      "\n",
