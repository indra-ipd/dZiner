      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mTo begin, I need to research design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption. This will help me make informed modifications to the initial SMILES structure.\n",

      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mTo design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 better, several strategies can be employed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Functionalization with Polar Groups**: Introducing functional groups such as OSO3H, NO2, OH, NH2, and N=C(R) can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption. These groups improve the selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases and increase the stability of the framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pore Size Optimization**: Engineering the pore size and shape to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 molecules can enhance selective adsorption. This involves designing MOFs with precise pore engineering to separate gas mixtures effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Since CO2 is an acidic gas, designing MOFs with appropriate acidity-basicity properties can prevent structural ruptures and ensure stability. This includes the careful selection of dopants and modifiers to maintain structural integrity and enhance adsorption capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modifying the organic linker either before or after MOF synthesis can improve CO2 capture efficiency. This can involve changing the organic linker or introducing specific functional groups during the synthesis process.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines are summarized from the paper titled \"Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation,\" DOI: 10.1002/tcr.202100230, published in \"The Chemical Record\" in 2022. To enhance the CO2 adsorption capabilities of the organic linker in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), several design strategies can be employed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Incorporation of Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functional groups such as aromatic amines can increase the interaction between the linker and CO2 molecules. For example, the use of aromatic amines in CAU-1 has been shown to improve CO2 uptake.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heteroatomic Functionalities**: Introducing heteroatoms like nitrogen into the linker can provide additional sites for CO2 interaction. An example is the use of Zn(btz) (btz = 5-bis(5-tetrazolo)-3-oxapentane), where non-coordinating nitrogen atoms are part of the linker and interact with CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Alkylamine Grafting**: Grafting alkylamines, such as N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen), onto the linker can significantly enhance CO2 uptake through chemisorptive processes. This method has been successfully applied in mmen-Mg-IRMOF-74-II.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing linkers to create hydrophobic environments and optimizing pore metrics can help in selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of water. For instance, ZIF-301 has been designed with these features to improve CO2 capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "These strategies are detailed in the paper titled \"The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks,\" published in Science in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444). The design guidelines for improving CO₂ adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by modifying the organic linker include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reducing Channel Diameter**: Using smaller ligands can reduce the channel diameter, which increases the volumetric density of open metal sites, enhancing CO₂ adsorption.\n",
      "2. **Increasing Open Metal Sites**: The presence of a high density of open metal sites in the MOF structure significantly improves CO₂ adsorption due to stronger adsorbate-adsorbent interactions.\n",
      "3. **Using Aliphatic Ligands**: Aliphatic ligands, which are generally cheaper and smaller than aromatic ligands, can be used to create MOFs with a higher density of open metal sites, thus improving CO₂ uptake.\n",
      "4. **Tuning Metal Selection**: The choice of metal in the MOF structure can influence the binding energetics of CO₂, allowing for optimization based on the specific metal used.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines are based on the study titled \"Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metal-Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture,\" published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C in 2017, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb CO₂ more effectively, the following guidelines can be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the organic linkers with metals, such as lithium (Li), can significantly enhance the adsorption strength due to increased electrostatic interactions and polarization effects.\n",
      "2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing functional groups like fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) can improve the physisorption behavior of CO₂ on the linkers. These groups enhance the electrostatic interactions between the CO₂ molecules and the linkers.\n",
      "3. **Hydrophobic Nature**: For practical applications, especially in humid environments, using hydrophobic linkers can minimize competitive water adsorption, thus improving CO₂ capture efficiency.\n",
      "4. **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: Increasing the surface area and pore volume of the MOFs by extending the length of the organic linkers can enhance gas adsorption. However, care must be taken to maintain the stability of the MOFs.\n",
      "5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Selecting linkers known for their high chemical and thermal stability is crucial for the long-term performance of MOFs in CO₂ capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled \"Designing organic bridging linkers of metal–organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption,\" published in the New Journal of Chemistry in 2024. The DOI for the paper is https://doi.org/10.1039/d4nj01197j.\u001b[0m\n",
