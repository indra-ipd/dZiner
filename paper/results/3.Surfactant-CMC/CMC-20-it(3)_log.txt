Action Input: Design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Increasing the chain length generally decreases the cmc, as described by the Klevens equation. Branching, especially at the chain termini, can also lower the cmc by promoting dense surface packing and reducing surface energy.

2. **Headgroup Modifications**: The nature of the headgroup affects the solubility and surface activity of the surfactant. For example, introducing bulky or highly polar headgroups can increase the cmc due to steric hindrance and increased dipolar interactions.

3. **Fluorination**: Replacing hydrogen atoms in the hydrophobic tail with fluorine atoms can significantly lower the cmc. Fluorinated surfactants exhibit lower surface tensions due to weaker intermolecular forces and greater hydrophobicity.

4. **Siloxane Backbones**: Using siloxane backbones can enhance the flexibility and surface activity of the surfactant, leading to lower cmc values. The unique flexibility of siloxane chains allows for efficient packing at the interface.

5. **Hedgehog Structures**: Introducing highly branched, bulkier groups (hedgehog surfactants) can also lower the cmc by promoting dense packing of the hydrophobic tails at the interface.

These guidelines are based on the analysis of surfactant structure-function relationships and their impact on surface properties.

**Reference**:
- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. Here are some guidelines based on the provided context:

1. **Tail Length and Structure**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. Additionally, converting a linear alkyl chain into a branched one can also increase the CMC.
2. **Head Group Modifications**: Increasing the size or polarity of the hydrophilic head group tends to increase the CMC. Adding polar groups to the head can achieve this effect.
3. **Aromatic Rings**: Replacing aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with less polar groups (e.g., cyclohexane) can decrease the CMC due to the reduction in polarity.

These guidelines are supported by the study titled "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants" published in *Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research* in 2016 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03141). The design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve modifying the molecular structure, particularly the functional groups and branching. Here are the key points:

1. **Counterions**: Use bromides as counterions to minimize the influence of other factors on the CMC value.
2. **Geometrical Structure**: The impact of modifying the geometrical structure on changes in the CMC value should be consistent, regardless of the counterion type.
3. **Branches and Heteroatoms**: Incorporate branches and heteroatoms in the spacer group to influence the CMC. For example, the CMC value increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight chains, and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched chains.
4. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: Utilize molecular connectivity indices, such as the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡), to predict and design the CMC. Increasing branching generally decreases the 1Ï‡Î½ index and increases the 2Ï‡ index.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for this paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:

1. **Hydrophobic Chain Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles.
   
2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group can significantly influence the CMC. For instance, larger or more polar head groups can increase the CMC due to enhanced solubility in water.

3. **Branching and Saturation**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail or using unsaturated bonds can affect the CMC. Branching typically increases the CMC, while unsaturation can either increase or decrease it depending on the specific structure.

4. **Functional Groups**: Adding functional groups such as hydroxyl, ether, or ester groups can modify the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and thus the CMC. For example, polyoxyethylene chains in the hydrophilic part can increase the CMC.

5. **Electrostatic Interactions**: For ionic surfactants, the presence of counterions and their valency can influence the CMC. Higher valency counterions generally reduce the CMC due to stronger electrostatic interactions.

6. **Temperature and Salinity**: The CMC is also affected by external conditions such as temperature and salinity. Higher temperatures can either increase or decrease the CMC depending on the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Salinity usually decreases the CMC for ionic surfactants due to the screening of electrostatic repulsions.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including:

- "Structure-based modeling of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of anionic surfactants in brine using intelligent methods," DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-40466-1, *Scientific Reports*, 2023.
- "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship approach," DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4778, *Journal of Colloid and Interface Science*, 1997.
- "Estimation of critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants with QSPR approach," DOI: 10.1016/j.theochem.2004.05.001, *Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM*, 2004.

These references provide detailed insights into how molecular descriptors and external conditions influence the CMC of surfactants. Designing a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves several considerations related to the molecular structure, particularly the tail length, headgroup composition, and counterions. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature of the headgroup significantly affects the CMC. For instance, larger or more complex headgroups can increase steric hindrance, which may increase the CMC. Conversely, smaller headgroups can decrease the CMC.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Counterions that form stronger ionic bonds with the headgroup can lower the CMC by stabilizing the micelle structure.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the tail or adding functional groups can affect the CMC. Branching typically increases the CMC due to reduced packing efficiency in the micelle core. Functional groups that increase hydrophilicity can also increase the CMC.

These guidelines are derived from various studies, including those that use molecular dynamics simulations and empirical models to predict CMCs based on molecular structure.

For more detailed insights, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating various molecular characteristics, including the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.
2. **Head Group Area**: Modifying the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups (e.g., ethylene oxide units) can adjust the balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, thereby tuning the CMC.
4. **Temperature**: The CMC is also temperature-dependent, so considering the operational temperature range is crucial in surfactant design.

These guidelines are supported by the study "QSPR for the prediction of critical micelle concentration of different classes of surfactants using machine learning algorithms," published in the *Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling* in 2024. The DOI for this paper is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2024.108757.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mBased on the design guidelines, here are the key points to consider for modifying the initial molecule to lower its Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. **Increase Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Longer hydrophobic tails generally decrease the CMC.
2. **Introduce Branching**: Branching, especially at the chain termini, can lower the CMC.
3. **Modify Headgroup**: Introducing bulkier or more polar headgroups can increase the CMC, so we should avoid this.
4. **Fluorination**: Replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine in the hydrophobic tail can lower the CMC.
5. **Siloxane Backbones**: Using siloxane backbones can enhance flexibility and lower the CMC.
6. **Hedgehog Structures**: Introducing highly branched, bulkier groups can lower the CMC.

Next, I will evaluate the initial SMILES and then start making modifications based on these guidelines.
