Action Input: Design guidelines for lowering Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) in molecules[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon chain generally decreases the cmc logarithmically, as described by the Klevens equation. Branching, especially at the chain termini with low-surface-energy groups like methyl (CH3âˆ’), can also lower the cmc by promoting dense surface packing.

2. **Headgroup Modifications**: The type and size of the headgroup affect the solubility and packing at the interface. Larger or more polar headgroups can increase the cmc by introducing steric hindrance and dipolar interactions, which can prevent dense packing of the hydrophobic tails.

3. **Substitution with Fluorine or Silicone**: Replacing hydrogen atoms in the hydrophobic tail with fluorine (fluorosurfactants) or using silicone-based tails can significantly lower the cmc. Fluorinated surfactants lower the cmc due to weaker intermolecular forces and greater hydrophobicity, while silicone surfactants benefit from the flexibility and low surface energy of the siloxane backbone.

4. **Branching and Bulkiness**: Introducing highly branched or bulky groups, referred to as "hedgehog" surfactants, can reduce the cmc by creating a more compact and less polarizable surface layer.

These guidelines help in designing surfactants with desired cmc values by manipulating the molecular structure to optimize surface activity and packing efficiency.

- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Here are some guidelines based on the provided context:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. Conversely, lengthening the tail decreases the CMC.
2. **Hydrophilic Head Size**: Increasing the size of the hydrophilic head tends to increase the CMC. Adding polar groups to the head can also raise the CMC.
3. **Branching**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC.
4. **Aromatic Rings**: Replacing aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with less polar groups (e.g., cyclohexane) can lower the CMC.

These guidelines are derived from the study which used a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict CMCs and validated the predictions with COSMOmic calculations. The study demonstrated that these structural modifications could effectively tune the CMC of surfactants.

**Reference**:
- Title: "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03492
- Journal: Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2016 The design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc) involve modifying the geometrical structure and functional groups of the molecule. Key points include:

1. **Counterions**: The study primarily used bromides as counterions to minimize the influence of other factors on cmc values. However, the model can be applied to surfactants with different counterions, as the impact of geometrical changes on cmc should be consistent across different counterions.

2. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: The cmc can be predicted using molecular connectivity indices, specifically the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡). These indices represent one-bond and two-bond fragments in the molecule, respectively, and their values depend on the isomers and branching of the compound.

3. **Functional Groups in Spacer Groups**: The cmc value is influenced by the type of functional groups in the spacer group. For example, the cmc increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight spacers, and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched spacers.

4. **Branching and Chain Length**: Increasing branching generally decreases the 1Ï‡Î½ index and increases the 2Ï‡ index. Extending hydrocarbon chains or adding atoms through branching also affects these indices and, consequently, the cmc.

5. **Spacer Chain Length**: The cmc may decrease with the elongation of spacer chains beyond six methylene groups, although this has not been extensively studied for star-shaped trimeric surfactants.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for the paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the molecule. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship approach," DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4663, *Journal of Colloid Interface Science*, 1997.

2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group significantly affect the CMC. Larger or more polar head groups tend to increase the CMC due to enhanced solubility in water.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction on critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants in aqueous solution: quantitative structure-property relationship approach," DOI: 10.3321/j.issn:0567-7351.2002.09.004, *Acta Chimica Sinica-Chinese Edition*, 2002.

3. **Branching and Compactness**: More branched hydrophobic tails or compact structures can increase the CMC. This is because branching reduces the effective hydrophobic interaction area, making micelle formation less favorable.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of some anionic surfactants using multiple regression techniques: A quantitative structure-activity relationship study," DOI: 10.1007/s11743-000-0111-5, *Journal of Surfactants and Detergents*, 2000.

4. **Electrostatic Interactions**: For ionic surfactants, the presence of counterions and their concentration can influence the CMC. Adding salts can screen electrostatic repulsions between head groups, thereby lowering the CMC.
   - **Reference**: "Effect of temperature and additives on the critical micelle concentration and thermodynamics of micelle formation of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide in aqueous solution: A conductometric study," DOI: 10.1016/j.jct.2013.12.014, *Journal of Chemical Thermodynamics*, 2014.

5. **Temperature**: The CMC typically decreases with increasing temperature up to a certain point, after which it may increase. This is due to changes in hydration and the balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions.
   - **Reference**: "Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena," DOI: 10.1002/9781118228920, *Wiley*, 2012.

By carefully adjusting these molecular features, one can design surfactants with desired CMC values for specific applications. Designing a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves several considerations based on the molecular structure, particularly the tail length, headgroup composition, and counterions. Here are the key guidelines:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature of the headgroup significantly affects the CMC. For nonionic surfactants, larger and more complex headgroups can increase steric hindrance, leading to higher CMCs. For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can also play a crucial role.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Surfactants with larger or more polarizable counterions tend to have lower CMCs due to better charge stabilization.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the hydrocarbon tail or adding functional groups can affect the CMC. Branching typically increases the CMC due to reduced packing efficiency in the micelle core.

These guidelines are derived from various studies, including molecular dynamics simulations and empirical models, which highlight the importance of these structural factors in determining the CMC.

For more detailed insights, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating various molecular characteristics, including the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance the hydrophobic interactions that drive micelle formation.
2. **Head Group Area**: Modifying the size and nature of the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups such as ethylene oxide units can affect the hydrophilicity and, consequently, the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units typically increases the hydrophilicity and the CMC.
4. **Temperature**: The CMC is also temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures generally leading to lower CMC values due to increased molecular motion and interaction.

These guidelines are supported by quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies and machine learning models that predict CMC based on molecular descriptors.

For more detailed information, refer to the paper titled "QSPR for the prediction of critical micelle concentration of different classes of surfactants using machine learning algorithms," DOI: 10.1016/j.jmgm.2024.108757, published in the Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling, 2024.[0m
