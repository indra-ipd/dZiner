Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Longer and more branched tails generally lower the cmc due to increased hydrophobic interactions.
2. **Headgroup Type**: The nature of the headgroup (e.g., ionic, nonionic) affects the solubility and aggregation behavior of the surfactant. Ionic headgroups tend to have higher cmc values compared to nonionic ones.
3. **Chain Branching**: Introducing branching in the hydrocarbon chains, especially at the chain termini, can lower the cmc by promoting dense surface packing and reducing surface energy.
4. **Fluorination**: Replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine in the hydrophobic tail can significantly lower the cmc due to the unique properties of fluorine, such as lower polarizability and greater molecular volume.
5. **Siloxane Backbones**: Using siloxane backbones can enhance flexibility and lower surface tension, which can also influence the cmc.

These guidelines are derived from the study of various surfactants, including hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, and silicone surfactants, and their structure-function relationships.

- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head. Here are some guidelines based on the provided context:

1. **Tail Length and Structure**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. Additionally, converting a linear alkyl chain into a branched one can also increase the CMC.
2. **Head Group Modifications**: Increasing the size of the hydrophilic head or adding polar groups to the head can raise the CMC.
3. **Aromatic Rings**: Breaking Ï€ bonds in aromatic rings (e.g., converting benzene to cyclohexane) can lower the CMC due to reduced polarity.

These guidelines are supported by the study "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03089, Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2016) and the study "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structure-property relationship approach" (DOI: 10.1021/la9501462, Langmuir, 1996). To design a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), the following guidelines can be considered based on the study:

1. **Geometrical Structure**: The CMC value is influenced by the geometrical structure of the surfactant. Increasing branching in the molecule tends to decrease the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and increase the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡), which affects the CMC.

2. **Functional Groups**: The type of functional groups in the spacer group significantly impacts the CMC. For example, the CMC value increases in the order of â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight chains and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched chains.

3. **Counterions**: While the study focused on bromides as counterions to minimize variability, the model can be applied to other counterions, assuming the impact of geometrical changes on CMC remains consistent.

4. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: Utilize molecular connectivity indices to predict and design the structure. The first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡) are crucial parameters in the polynomial regression model used to predict the logarithm of the CMC.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for this paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the surfactant. Here are some guidelines based on various studies:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship approach," DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4661, *Journal of Colloid Interface Science*, 1997.

2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group significantly affect the CMC. Larger or more polar head groups increase the CMC due to enhanced solubility in water.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction on critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants in aqueous solution: quantitative structure-property relationship approach," DOI: 10.3321/j.issn:0567-7351.2002.09.008, *Acta Chimica Sinica-Chinese Edition*, 2002.

3. **Branching and Compactness**: More branched hydrophobic tails or compact structures tend to increase the CMC. This is because branching reduces the effective hydrophobic interaction area.
   - **Reference**: "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of some anionic surfactants using multiple regression techniques: A quantitative structure-activity relationship study," DOI: 10.1007/s11743-000-0111-1, *Journal of Surfactants and Detergents*, 2000.

4. **Electrostatic Interactions**: For ionic surfactants, the presence of counterions and their concentration can influence the CMC. Higher ionic strength in the solution generally lowers the CMC.
   - **Reference**: "Effect of temperature and additives on the critical micelle concentration and thermodynamics of micelle formation of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide in aqueous solution: A conductometric study," DOI: 10.1016/j.jct.2014.01.003, *Journal of Chemical Thermodynamics*, 2014.

5. **Temperature and pH**: The CMC is also affected by temperature and pH. Generally, the CMC decreases with increasing temperature up to a certain point and then increases. The pH can affect the ionization state of the surfactant, thereby influencing the CMC.
   - **Reference**: "Effect of pH on the critical micelle concentration of sodium dodecyl sulphate," DOI: 10.1002/app.1983.070280413, *Journal of Applied Polymer Science*, 1983.

By considering these guidelines, one can design surfactants with desired CMC values for specific applications. Designing a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves several considerations related to the molecular structure, particularly the tail length, headgroup composition, and counterions. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature of the headgroup significantly affects the CMC. For nonionic surfactants, larger and more complex headgroups can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance. For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can also play a crucial role.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Surfactants with larger, more polarizable counterions tend to have lower CMCs.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the tail or adding functional groups can affect the CMC. Branching generally increases the CMC due to reduced packing efficiency in the micelle core.

These guidelines are derived from various studies, including those that use molecular dynamics simulations, coarse-grained simulations, and empirical models to predict CMCs.

Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating various molecular features such as the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance the hydrophobic interactions that drive micelle formation.
2. **Head Group Area**: Modifying the size and nature of the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups such as ethylene oxide units can affect the hydrophilicity and, consequently, the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units typically increases the hydrophilicity and the CMC.
4. **Temperature**: The CMC is also temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures generally leading to lower CMC values due to increased molecular motion and interaction.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including the one by Nada Boukelkal et al., which utilized quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodologies to predict the CMC of surfactants based on their molecular descriptors. The study highlighted the importance of molecular features such as SLogP, GATS6d, and temperature in determining the CMC.
