Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: "design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)"[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Longer and more branched tails generally lower the cmc due to increased hydrophobic interactions. For example, trichain hydrocarbon surfactants can achieve cmc values comparable to certain fluorosurfactants, although their synthesis is complex.

2. **Headgroup Modifications**: The nature of the headgroup affects the solubility and packing at the interface. Water-soluble headgroups are essential for promoting water solubility but can increase the cmc due to steric hindrance.

3. **Chain Branching**: Introducing branching, especially at the chain termini with low-surface-energy groups like methyl (CH3) groups, can lower the cmc by promoting dense surface packing and reducing intermolecular forces.

4. **Chemical Nature of the Tail**: Fluorocarbon tails, due to their lower polarizability and larger molecular volume, can significantly lower the cmc compared to hydrocarbon tails. However, environmental concerns necessitate finding alternatives.

5. **Surface Packing Index (Ï•cmc)**: This parameter represents the volume fraction of surfactant chain fragments in a surface film at the aqueous cmc and can be used to predict and design surfactants with desired surface properties.

These guidelines are based on the analysis of surfactant structure-function relationships and their impact on surface properties, particularly the cmc.

**Reference**:
- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) can be summarized as follows:

1. **Tail Length and Head Area**: Shorter hydrophobic tails and larger hydrophilic heads generally increase the CMC. This is because these modifications reduce the hydrophobic effect, making it easier for the surfactant to dissolve in water before forming micelles.
   
2. **Addition of Polar Groups**: Introducing polar groups to the surfactant's head can increase the CMC. Polar groups enhance the hydrophilicity of the head, which promotes solubility in water and delays micelle formation.

3. **Branching of Alkyl Chains**: Converting linear alkyl chains into branched ones can also increase the CMC. Branching disrupts the packing efficiency of the hydrophobic tails within the micelle core, making micelle formation less favorable.

4. **Removal of Side Chains**: Removing side chains from the surfactant tail can increase the CMC. This modification reduces the hydrophobic character of the tail, thus requiring a higher concentration for micelle formation.

5. **Reduction of Ï€ Bonds**: Breaking Ï€ bonds in aromatic rings (e.g., converting benzene to cyclohexane) can lower the CMC. Aromatic rings with Ï€ bonds have higher polarity, which can stabilize micelles and reduce the CMC.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants," published in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research in 2016. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03145. To design a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Geometrical Structure**: The cmc value is influenced by the molecular connectivity indices, which represent the structure of the molecule. Increasing branching in the molecule generally decreases the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and increases the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡), which affects the cmc value.

2. **Functional Groups**: The type of functional groups in the spacer group significantly impacts the cmc value. For example, the cmc value increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight spacers and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched spacers.

3. **Spacer Chain Length**: The length of the spacer chains also affects the cmc. For star-shaped trimeric surfactants, the cmc may decrease with the elongation of spacer chains beyond six methylene groups.

4. **Counterions**: Although the study primarily focuses on bromide counterions, the model can be applied to other counterions like chloride, as the changes in cmc due to geometrical structure modifications are expected to be similar.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for this paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head groups. Here are some guidelines based on various studies:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length and Structure**:
   - Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles.
   - Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance, which reduces the efficiency of micelle formation.

2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**:
   - The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group significantly affect the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups tend to increase the CMC because they enhance the solubility of the surfactant in water, making micelle formation less favorable.
   - Functional groups that increase the polarity of the head group, such as sulfonates or sulfates, can also increase the CMC.

3. **Temperature and Salinity Effects**:
   - The CMC is influenced by temperature and salinity. Generally, increasing temperature initially decreases the CMC to a minimum point, after which it increases with further temperature rise.
   - Adding salts to the solution can decrease the CMC by screening electrostatic repulsions between charged head groups, facilitating micelle formation.

4. **Molecular Descriptors**:
   - Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) models suggest that molecular descriptors such as the Kier and Hall molecular connectivity index, dipole moment, and Balaban distance connectivity index are crucial for predicting CMC. These descriptors relate to the molecular size, shape, and electronic properties of the surfactant.

For detailed guidelines and models, refer to the following papers:
- "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship approach," DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4621, Journal of Colloid Interface Science, 1997.
- "Estimation of critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants with QSPR approach," DOI: 10.1016/j.theochem.2004.05.001, Journal of Molecular Structure (Theochem), 2004.
- "Correlation of critical micelle concentration of sodium alkyl benzenesulfonates with molecular descriptors," DOI: 10.1007/BF02830715, Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences, 2006.

These studies provide comprehensive insights into how molecular modifications can be used to tailor the CMC of surfactants. To design a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), consider the following guidelines based on changes to the functional groups or other molecular modifications:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Size and Type**: The size and type of the headgroup significantly influence the CMC. Larger or more polar headgroups can increase the CMC due to steric and electrostatic repulsions. For example, sugar-based surfactants with complex headgroups may require careful adjustment to achieve the desired CMC.

3. **Counterions for Ionic Surfactants**: The type of counterion in ionic surfactants affects the CMC. Surfactants with larger or more polarizable counterions typically have higher CMCs. For instance, quaternary ammonium salts as counterions can significantly alter the CMC.

4. **Branching in Tail Groups**: Introducing branching in the hydrocarbon tail can increase the CMC. Branched tails reduce the packing efficiency in micelles, requiring higher concentrations for micelle formation.

5. **Functional Group Modifications**: Adding functional groups that increase the hydrophilicity of the headgroup or the hydrophobicity of the tail can be used to fine-tune the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units to the headgroup can increase the CMC.

These guidelines are derived from the study of various surfactant systems and their CMCs, as discussed in the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.
2. **Head Group Area**: The size and nature of the head group can significantly impact the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups can alter the surfactant's properties. For example, adding ethylene oxide units can increase hydrophilicity, thus increasing the CMC.
4. **Temperature and Ionic Strength**: These external factors also play a role. Higher temperatures and ionic strengths can lower the CMC by reducing the repulsion between head groups.

These guidelines are supported by the study "QSPR for the prediction of critical micelle concentration of different classes of surfactants using machine learning algorithms" published in the *Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling* in 2024.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe modified SMILES "CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)CC(=O)NC1CC(N)OC1=O" is valid with a synthetic accessibility (SA) score of 3.43 and a molecular weight of 340.46 g/mol. Now, I will predict the logCMC for this new molecule.

Observation: [38;5;200m[1;3m(1.68, 0.558)[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe modified SMILES "CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)CC(=O)NC1CC(N)OC1=O" has a logCMC of 1.68 with a standard deviation of 0.558. This is not an improvement over the previous molecule with the extended hydrophobic tail. I will revert to the previous valid SMILES with the best logCMC and try another modification.

Next, I will try adding a different polar group to the tail to see its effect on the CMC.

Action: Modify the SMILES string to add a carboxyl group to the tail.
