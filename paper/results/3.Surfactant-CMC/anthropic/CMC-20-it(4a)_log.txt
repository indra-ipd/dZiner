Action Input: design guidelines for lower Critical Micelle Concentration
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mBased on the review article "Surfactants at the Design Limit" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336, published in Langmuir in 2015), some key design guidelines for making surfactants with low Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) and low surface tension at the CMC include:

1. Increase hydrophobicity of the tail:
- Use fluorocarbon or silicone-based tails instead of hydrocarbon tails
- For hydrocarbon tails, increase chain length or branching

2. Optimize tail structure:
- Incorporate highly branched, bulky groups ("hedgehog" surfactants) 
- Use trichain surfactants instead of single or double chains
- Increase chain tip methylation

3. Balance hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts:
- Minimize the size of the hydrophilic headgroup
- Maximize packing density of hydrophobic groups at the interface

4. Consider flexibility:
- Use flexible backbones (like siloxanes) that allow efficient packing

5. Minimize dipolar interactions:
- Reduce dipolar contributions from headgroups while maintaining water solubility

6. Maximize van der Waals interactions between tails

The goal is to create dense surface layers of low-energy groups (like CF3- or CH3-) while maintaining adequate water solubility. This allows achieving low surface tensions approaching those of the pure hydrophobic liquids.

The authors emphasize that the limiting surface tension (Î³cmc) results from balancing these various structural factors to optimize surfactant packing and interactions at the air-water interface. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for modifying surfactants to influence their Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Tail length: Shorter hydrophobic tails generally lead to higher CMCs.

2. Head size: Larger hydrophilic heads typically result in higher CMCs.

3. Adding polar groups: Incorporating additional polar groups to the polar head tends to increase the CMC.

4. Branching: Converting linear alkyl chains to branched ones can increase the CMC.

5. Aromaticity: Replacing aromatic groups (e.g. benzene) with less polar cyclic groups (e.g. cyclohexane) can lower the CMC.

6. Chain length: Removing side chains or reducing the length of polar head chains can affect the CMC, though the overall effect depends on other structural factors.

These guidelines are derived from the saliency map analysis and design examples presented in the paper. The authors demonstrate that their Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model can predict CMC changes consistent with these principles, which are also validated by COSMOmic calculations.

It's important to note that these are general guidelines, and the actual effect on CMC may depend on the interplay of multiple structural factors. The GCN model developed in this study provides a more comprehensive tool for predicting CMCs across various surfactant classes.

This information is summarized from the paper:

Title: "Predicting critical micelle concentrations for surfactants using graph convolutional neural networks"

DOI: 10.1039/D1SC03795D

Journal: Chemical Science

Year: 2021 Based on the paper "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic trimeric star-shaped surfactants using molecular connectivity indices" published in Scientific Reports in 2024 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6), the following design guidelines can be summarized for modifying the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Molecular structure: The overall geometrical structure of the surfactant significantly affects the CMC. Star-shaped trimeric surfactants were the focus of this study.

2. Branching: Increasing branching in the molecule tends to decrease the CMC value. This is reflected in the molecular connectivity indices used in the model.

3. Chain length: Extending the hydrocarbon chains or adding atoms to the chains through branching generally decreases the CMC.

4. Spacer group composition: The nature of atoms in the spacer group influences the CMC. For example, replacing -CH2- with -NH- or -O- in the spacer group increases the CMC.

5. Spacer group structure: Straight chain spacers tend to have lower CMC values compared to branched spacers with similar compositions.

6. Heteroatoms: The presence and type of heteroatoms in the molecule affect the CMC. This is captured by the valence connectivity indices in the model.

7. Counterions: While the study focused on bromide counterions, it's noted that the type of counterion can influence the CMC.

8. Symmetry: Symmetrical structures tend to have lower CMC values compared to asymmetrical ones with similar composition.

These guidelines are based on the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model developed in the study, which uses molecular connectivity indices to predict the CMC of cationic trimeric star-shaped surfactants. The model provides a way to estimate the impact of structural changes on the CMC, allowing for the design of surfactants with desired self-aggregation properties. Based on the research, there are several key design guidelines for modifying surfactants to achieve a desired Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is one of the most significant factors.

2. Branching: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail tends to increase the CMC compared to linear chains of the same carbon number.

3. Hydrophilic head group: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups typically lead to higher CMC values.

4. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can impact CMC. Generally, larger counterions lead to lower CMC values.

5. Aromatic groups: Incorporating aromatic groups in the hydrophobic portion tends to lower the CMC.

6. Degree of ethoxylation: For nonionic surfactants, increasing the number of ethylene oxide units in the head group increases the CMC.

7. Position of hydrophilic group: The position of the hydrophilic group relative to the hydrophobic tail can affect CMC.

These guidelines are summarized from several sources, including:

1. "Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena" by Milton J. Rosen and Joy T. Kunjappu, published in Wiley, 2012. DOI: 10.1002/9781118228920

2. "A review on progress in QSPR studies for surfactants" by Jie Hu et al., published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2010. DOI: 10.3390/ijms11031020

3. "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants using multiple regression techniques: A quantitative structure-activity relationship study" by Jalali-Heravi and Konouz, published in Journal of Surfactants and Detergents, 2000. DOI: 10.1007/s11743-000-0113-4

It's important to note that these guidelines provide general trends, but the specific effect can vary depending on the overall molecular structure and environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and salinity. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Tail length: Increasing the hydrocarbon tail length generally decreases the CMC. This follows the Stauff-Kleven's relationship, which shows CMC decreases exponentially with an increase in the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon tail.

2. Headgroup composition: Changing the headgroup can significantly affect the CMC. The model identified environments from sugar-based surfactant headgroups as important for nonionic surfactants.

3. Ionic vs. nonionic: Ionic surfactants typically have much larger CMCs than nonionic surfactants. The choice of counterion for ionic surfactants is important.

4. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can greatly influence the CMC. The model identified chloride (Cl-) and bromide (Br-) as important environments.

5. Branching: Branch points in a carbon chain are distinguished from main-chain groups, suggesting that branching in the tail can affect CMC.

6. Polarity difference: The difference in polarity between the head and tail of a surfactant can impact CMC prediction accuracy and likely the CMC itself.

7. Anisotropy of ionic groups: Highly anisotropic quaternary ammonium salts (quats) can behave differently from isotropic ones, potentially leading to unexpected CMC values.

It's important to note that these guidelines are based on the model's predictions and may have limitations, especially for molecules outside the model's applicability domain.

Title: "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning"
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868
Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation
Year: 2023 Based on the research in this field, there are several key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. Longer hydrocarbon chains lead to stronger hydrophobic interactions and easier micelle formation.

2. Hydrophilic head group: The size and nature of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups tend to increase CMC due to increased steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between molecules.

3. Counterion effect: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence CMC. Generally, larger counterions with lower charge density lead to lower CMC values.

4. Branching: Branching in the hydrophobic tail typically increases CMC compared to linear chains of the same carbon number, due to less efficient packing.

5. Unsaturation: Introduction of double bonds in the hydrophobic tail usually increases CMC slightly compared to saturated chains.

6. Temperature: CMC generally increases with temperature for ionic surfactants, while it may decrease initially and then increase for nonionic surfactants.

7. Additives: The presence of electrolytes or organic compounds can affect CMC by altering the solvation of the surfactant molecules.

These guidelines are summarized from the following paper:
