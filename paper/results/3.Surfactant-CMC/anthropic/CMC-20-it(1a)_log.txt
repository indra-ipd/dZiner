Action Input: design guidelines for lower Critical Micelle Concentration
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mBased on the review article "Surfactants at the Design Limit" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336, published in Langmuir in 2015), some key design guidelines for making surfactants with low Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) and low surface tension at the CMC (Î³cmc) include:

1. Increasing hydrophobicity of the tail group: Longer and more hydrophobic tail groups generally lead to lower CMC values.

2. Optimizing chain branching: Branched hydrocarbon tails can lead to lower Î³cmc values compared to linear chains by increasing the density of low surface energy methyl (-CH3) groups at the interface.

3. Utilizing fluorocarbon or silicone-based tails: These provide lower surface tensions than hydrocarbon tails due to their lower polarizability and larger molecular volumes.

4. Balancing tail-tail interactions: Weaker tail-tail interactions allow for denser packing at the interface, leading to lower Î³cmc.

5. Minimizing headgroup size/interactions: Smaller headgroups allow for tighter packing of tail groups at the interface.

6. Incorporating low surface energy groups: Methyl (-CH3) termini on branched tails can help lower surface tension.

7. Optimizing flexibility: Flexible backbones (like siloxanes) allow for better orientation of low surface energy groups at the interface.

8. Balancing water solubility: The surfactant needs to remain water-soluble while maximizing hydrophobicity of the tail.

The authors emphasize that the goal is to maximize the packing density of low surface energy groups (like -CH3) at the air-water interface while maintaining water solubility. This often involves a delicate balance between opposing factors affecting surface activity and solubility. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Tail length: Shorter hydrophobic tails generally lead to higher CMCs.

2. Head size: Larger hydrophilic heads typically result in higher CMCs.

3. Adding polar groups: Incorporating more polar groups into the surfactant structure tends to increase the CMC.

4. Branching: Converting linear alkyl chains to branched structures can increase the CMC.

5. Aromaticity: Replacing aromatic groups (e.g. benzene) with less polar cyclic groups (e.g. cyclohexane) can lower the CMC.

6. Head chain length: Reducing the length of polar head chains may decrease the CMC, though this effect can be counteracted by other modifications.

These guidelines are derived from the analysis of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model trained on surfactant structures and their corresponding CMCs. The model provides insights into how different molecular features impact the CMC.

It's important to note that these guidelines offer general trends, but the precise effect of structural changes can be complex and may depend on the specific surfactant class and other molecular features.

This information is summarized from the paper:

Title: "Predicting critical micelle concentrations for surfactants using graph convolutional neural networks"

DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c02191

Journal: The Journal of Physical Chemistry B

Year: 2021 Based on the paper "Molecular connectivity indices for modeling of the critical micelle concentration of cationic star-shaped trimeric surfactants" published in Scientific Reports in 2024 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6), here are some key design guidelines for modifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of star-shaped trimeric surfactants:

1. Alkyl chain length: Increasing the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chains decreases the CMC value.

2. Spacer group composition: 
   - For straight chain spacers, CMC increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“
   - For branched spacers, CMC increases in the order: â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH

3. Spacer group structure: Branched spacers generally result in higher CMC values compared to straight chain spacers with the same heteroatom.

4. Branching: Increasing branching in the molecule tends to increase the CMC value.

5. Number of atoms: Adding atoms to the chains through branching or extending hydrocarbon chains generally decreases the CMC.

6. Heteroatoms: The presence and type of heteroatoms in the spacer group affect the CMC value.

The study used molecular connectivity indices to model these relationships, particularly the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡). These indices capture information about the molecule's structure, branching, and heteroatom content, allowing for predictions of CMC values based on structural modifications.

By manipulating these structural features, researchers can design star-shaped trimeric surfactants with desired CMC values for specific applications. The model presented in this paper provides a quantitative approach to predicting CMC values based on molecular structure, which can guide the rational design of new surfactants. Based on the information provided in the context, here are some key design guidelines for making surfactants with a desired Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the carbon chain length in the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is evident from the Klevens equation (Eq. 1) which shows an inverse relationship between CMC and the number of carbon atoms in the surfactant tail.

2. Hydrophilic head group: The size and nature of the hydrophilic head group can affect the CMC. Parameters like the relative number of carbon atoms in the hydrophilic moiety (h-sum-RNC) influence the CMC.

3. Molecular shape and branching: Descriptors like the Kier shape index (KS3) and Wiener number (WI) suggest that the overall molecular shape and branching can impact the CMC.

4. Polarity: The total dipole moment (TDIP) of the surfactant molecule is an important factor affecting the CMC.

5. Atomic charges: Parameters like the maximum net atomic charges on carbon atoms (QC-max) can influence the CMC.

6. Environmental factors: While not directly related to molecular design, factors like temperature, pH, and salinity significantly affect the CMC and should be considered in surfactant design for specific applications.

These guidelines are summarized from multiple studies discussed in the paper:

Title: "Structure-based modeling of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of anionic surfactants in brine using intelligent methods"
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40466-1
Journal: Scientific Reports
Year: 2023

It's important to note that these are general guidelines, and the specific impact of each factor can vary depending on the type of surfactant and the intended application. The paper emphasizes the complexity of predicting CMC and the need for advanced modeling techniques to account for multiple factors simultaneously. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Tail length: Increasing the hydrocarbon tail length generally decreases the CMC. This follows the Stauff-Kleven's relationship, which shows CMC decreases exponentially with increasing number of carbons in the hydrocarbon tail.

2. Headgroup composition: Changing the headgroup can significantly affect the CMC. For example, nonionic surfactants typically have lower CMCs compared to ionic surfactants.

3. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the choice of counterion can impact the CMC. The paper notes that chloride and bromide counterions were among the most important factors for ionic surfactants.

4. Branching: The structure of the hydrocarbon tail, including branching, can influence the CMC.

5. Polarity difference: The difference in polarity between the head and tail groups affects micelle formation. Greater differences generally lead to lower CMCs.

6. Headgroup size: The average cross-sectional area of the headgroup influences steric effects and impacts CMC.

7. Functional groups: Incorporating specific functional groups, especially in the headgroup region, can fine-tune the CMC.

It's important to note that these guidelines are general, and the specific impact of changes can vary depending on the overall molecular structure and composition. The paper emphasizes that predictive models, such as the graph neural network approach presented, can provide more accurate guidance for specific molecular designs.

Title: "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning"

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868

Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation

Year: 2023 Based on the research in this field, there are several key design guidelines for tailoring surfactants to achieve a desired Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. Longer hydrocarbon chains lead to stronger hydrophobic interactions and promote micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. Head group size and charge: Larger head groups tend to increase CMC due to increased steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between molecules. Ionic surfactants typically have higher CMCs than nonionic surfactants due to electrostatic repulsion.

3. Branching: Branched hydrophobic tails often result in higher CMCs compared to linear chains of the same carbon number, as branching reduces hydrophobic interactions.

4. Presence of aromatic groups: Incorporating aromatic rings in the hydrophobic portion can lower the CMC due to enhanced Ï€-Ï€ interactions between molecules.

5. Degree of ethoxylation: For nonionic surfactants, increasing the number of ethylene oxide units in the hydrophilic portion generally increases the CMC.

6. Counterion selection: For ionic surfactants, the choice of counterion can affect the CMC. Generally, larger counterions lead to lower CMCs.

7. Introduction of polar groups: Adding polar groups (e.g., -OH, -COOH) in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC by enhancing hydrophilicity.

8. Temperature sensitivity: Designing surfactants with temperature-responsive groups can allow for CMC modulation with temperature changes.

These guidelines are supported by the following paper:
