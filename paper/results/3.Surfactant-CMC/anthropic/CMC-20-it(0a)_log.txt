Action Input: design guidelines for lower Critical Micelle Concentration
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mBased on the review article "Surfactants at the Design Limit" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336, published in Langmuir in 2015), some key design guidelines for making surfactants with low Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) and low surface tension at the CMC include:

1. Increasing hydrophobicity of the tail group:
- Using fluorocarbon or silicone-based tails instead of hydrocarbon tails
- Increasing the chain length or branching of hydrocarbon tails

2. Optimizing tail group structure:
- Using branched or bulky tail groups to increase surface packing density
- Incorporating low surface energy groups like CF3- or CH3- at chain ends

3. Balancing hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions:
- Tuning the headgroup size/charge relative to the tail to achieve optimal packing

4. Considering molecular flexibility:
- Using flexible backbones (like siloxanes) to allow better surface organization

5. Maximizing surface coverage:
- Designing molecules that can pack densely at the air-water interface

6. Minimizing dipolar interactions:
- Reducing polarity in the tail region while maintaining water solubility

The authors emphasize that the goal is to maximize van der Waals interactions between tail groups while minimizing unfavorable interactions with water. They introduce a "surface packing index" to quantify how efficiently surfactants pack at the interface, which can guide molecular design.

By applying these principles, it may be possible to develop new hydrocarbon-based surfactants that approach the performance of fluorosurfactants, without the associated environmental concerns. Based on the information provided in the paper "Predicting Critical Micelle Concentrations for Surfactants Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" (DOI not provided, published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B in 2021), some key design guidelines for modifying surfactant Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) include:

1. Tail length: Shorter hydrophobic tails generally lead to higher CMCs.

2. Head size: Larger hydrophilic heads typically result in higher CMCs.

3. Adding polar groups: Incorporating more polar groups to the surfactant head tends to increase the CMC.

4. Branching: Converting linear alkyl chains to branched structures can increase the CMC.

5. Aromaticity: Replacing aromatic groups (e.g., benzene) with less polar cyclic groups (e.g., cyclohexane) can lower the CMC.

6. Side chains: Removing side chains from the surfactant tail can increase the CMC.

7. Polar head chain length: Reducing the length of polar head chains can potentially decrease the CMC, though this effect may be counteracted by other modifications.

The paper demonstrates that these guidelines are consistent with both graph convolutional neural network (GCN) predictions and COSMOmic calculations. It's important to note that some modifications may have competing effects on the CMC, making it challenging to predict the overall impact without computational tools.

These design principles provide a starting point for rational surfactant design, allowing researchers to make informed modifications to surfactant structures to achieve desired CMC values. However, the authors emphasize that their GCN model can provide more accurate and comprehensive predictions across various surfactant classes compared to traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Based on the paper "Quantitative structure-property relationship study of critical micelle concentration of cationic trimeric star-shaped surfactants using molecular connectivity indices" published in Scientific Reports in 2024 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6), here are some key design guidelines for modifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Molecular structure: The overall geometrical structure of the surfactant significantly impacts CMC. Star-shaped trimeric surfactants were the focus of this study.

2. Hydrocarbon chain length: Increasing the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chains generally decreases the CMC value.

3. Branching: Increased branching in the molecule tends to increase the CMC value.

4. Spacer group composition: The type of atoms or groups in the spacer affects CMC. For example, replacing -CH2- with -NH- or -O- in the spacer group increases the CMC.

5. Spacer group structure: Linear spacers generally result in lower CMC values compared to branched spacers.

6. Heteroatoms: The presence and type of heteroatoms in the molecule influence the CMC.

7. Counterions: While the study focused on bromide counterions, it's noted that the type of counterion can affect CMC.

8. Molecular connectivity indices: The first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡) were found to be particularly useful in predicting CMC values.

The study provides a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model that can be used to predict CMC values based on these molecular features. This model can guide the design of new surfactants with desired CMC properties by manipulating the molecular structure according to these guidelines. Based on the literature, there are several key design guidelines for tailoring the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is one of the most effective ways to lower CMC.

2. Branching: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail tends to increase CMC compared to linear chains of the same carbon number.

3. Hydrophilic head group: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups typically lead to higher CMC values.

4. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence CMC. Generally, larger counterions lead to lower CMC values.

5. Aromatic groups: Incorporating aromatic rings in the hydrophobic portion can lower CMC due to increased hydrophobicity.

6. Degree of ethoxylation: For nonionic surfactants, increasing the number of ethylene oxide units in the head group tends to increase CMC.

7. Position of functional groups: The location of functional groups along the hydrophobic chain can affect CMC.

These guidelines are supported by the following paper:

This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of structure-property relationships for surfactants, including factors affecting CMC. It emphasizes that while these guidelines are generally applicable, exceptions can occur due to the complex interplay of various structural features in surfactant molecules. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Tail length: Increasing the hydrocarbon tail length generally decreases the CMC. This follows the Stauff-Kleven's relationship, which shows CMC decreases exponentially with an increase in the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon tail.

2. Headgroup composition: Changing the headgroup can significantly affect the CMC. The model identified environments from sugar-based surfactant headgroups as important factors.

3. Ionic vs. nonionic: Ionic surfactants typically have much larger CMCs than nonionic surfactants. The choice of counterion for ionic surfactants is important.

4. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can greatly influence the CMC. The model identified chloride (Cl-) and bromide (Br-) as important counterions.

5. Branching: Branch points in a carbon chain are distinguished from main-chain groups, suggesting that branching in the tail can affect CMC.

6. Balance between head and tail: The relative polarity difference between the head and tail groups can impact CMC prediction accuracy and micelle formation behavior.

7. Anisotropy of ionic groups: Highly anisotropic quaternary ammonium salts (quats) can behave differently from isotropic counterions, potentially leading to unexpected CMC values.

It's important to note that these guidelines are based on the model's predictions and may have limitations, especially for molecules outside the model's training domain. The applicability domain of the model should be considered when designing new surfactants.

Title: "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning"
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868
Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation
Year: 2023 Based on the research in this area, there are several key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. Longer hydrocarbon chains lead to stronger hydrophobic interactions and easier micelle formation.

2. Hydrophilic head group: The size and nature of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups tend to increase CMC due to increased steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between molecules.

3. Counterion effects: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence CMC. Generally, larger counterions with lower charge density lead to lower CMC values.

4. Branching: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail typically increases CMC compared to linear chains of the same carbon number.

5. Unsaturation: Adding double bonds to the hydrophobic tail usually increases CMC slightly compared to saturated chains.

6. Temperature: CMC generally increases with temperature for ionic surfactants, while it may decrease for nonionic surfactants.

7. Additives: The presence of salts or organic compounds can affect CMC by changing the solvent environment.

8. pH: For surfactants with ionizable groups, pH can significantly impact CMC by altering the charge state of the molecule.

These guidelines are summarized from the following paper:

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The addition of a second fluorine atom has slightly increased the logCMC from -1.083 to -0.976. This suggests that the second fluorine atom did not provide additional benefit in lowering the CMC. Let's return to our previous best structure and try a different modification. We could try replacing the cyclic ester with a simpler ester group, which might affect the overall hydrophilicity of the molecule.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The replacement of the cyclic ester with a simpler ester group has increased the logCMC from -1.083 to 0.308. This suggests that the cyclic ester structure was actually beneficial for lowering the CMC. Let's return to our best structure so far and try a different approach. We could try introducing a small amount of branching near the middle of the hydrophobic tail, which might affect the packing of the molecules without disrupting the overall hydrophobicity too much.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The introduction of branching in the middle of the hydrophobic tail has increased the logCMC from -1.083 to 1.254. This suggests that the branching has disrupted the optimal packing of the molecules, leading to a higher CMC. At this point, we have explored several modifications, and our best result remains the structure with a longer hydrophobic tail, a fluorine atom at the end, and a sulfur atom replacing one carbonyl group. Let's try one more modification based on this structure. We could try replacing the remaining carbonyl group with a thiocarbonyl group to see if it further enhances the effect we observed with the sulfur atom.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The replacement of the carbonyl group with a thiocarbonyl group has resulted in a logCMC of -1.076, which is very close to our best result of -1.083. While it didn't improve the CMC further, it maintained a similar low value. At this point, we have explored various modifications and have generated 20 new SMILES candidates. Let's summarize our findings and provide the final answer.
