[32;1m[1;3mThought: To start this task, I need to research the design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC). This will help me make informed decisions when modifying the given SMILES.

Action Input: design guidelines for lower Critical Micelle Concentration
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mBased on the review article "Surfactants at the Design Limit" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336, published in Langmuir in 2015), some key design guidelines for surfactants with low Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) and low surface tension at the CMC (Î³cmc) include:

1. Hydrophobic tail design:
- Use highly branched, bulky hydrocarbon groups rather than linear chains to create dense surface packing of CH3- groups
- Incorporate low surface energy moieties like fluorocarbon or siloxane groups 
- Increase chain length to lower CMC (follows Klevens equation)

2. Headgroup considerations:  
- Minimize the size/volume of the hydrophilic headgroup to allow tighter packing at the interface
- Balance hydrophilicity to maintain water solubility while maximizing surface activity

3. Overall molecular architecture:
- Design "hedgehog" surfactants with branched, spiky structures 
- Use multi-chain surfactants (e.g. triple-chain) rather than single linear chains
- Incorporate flexible backbones (like siloxanes) to allow optimal orientation of low-energy groups

4. Specific chemical features:
- Maximize the number of terminal methyl (CH3-) groups 
- Minimize polar/dipolar interactions in the tail region
- Balance dispersion forces to promote dense surface packing

The goal is to create surfactants that can form dense, low-energy surfaces with minimal steric hindrance from headgroups. This allows achieving Î³cmc values approaching the surface tensions of the pure hydrophobic moieties themselves.

By following these guidelines, it may be possible to design hydrocarbon-based surfactants that can match or exceed the performance of fluorosurfactants, providing more environmentally-friendly alternatives. Based on the information provided in the paper "Predicting Critical Micelle Concentrations for Surfactants Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" (DOI not provided, published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B in 2021), some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants include:

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Shorter hydrophobic tails generally lead to higher CMCs, while longer tails result in lower CMCs.

2. Hydrophilic head size: Larger hydrophilic heads tend to increase the CMC.

3. Branching: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC.

4. Polarity: Adding polar groups to the surfactant structure, particularly near the head group, can increase the CMC.

5. Aromatic groups: Converting aromatic groups (e.g., benzene) to aliphatic groups (e.g., cyclohexane) can lower the CMC due to decreased polarity.

6. Chain linearity: Linear alkyl chains generally result in lower CMCs compared to branched chains.

The paper demonstrates these principles through examples where they modify surfactant structures and predict the resulting changes in CMC using their Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) model. They validate these predictions using COSMOmic calculations, showing that the GCN predictions align with physical intuition and more complex computational methods.

It's important to note that these guidelines provide general trends, but the exact impact on CMC can depend on the specific molecular structure and the interplay between different modifications. The GCN model developed in this study offers a tool for more precise predictions across a wide range of surfactant types. Based on the study "Quantitative structure-property relationship modeling of critical micelle concentration of cationic star-shaped trimeric surfactants" published in Scientific Reports in 2024 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6), the following design guidelines can be summarized for modifying the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of star-shaped trimeric surfactants:

1. Alkyl chain length: Increasing the length of the alkyl chains decreases the CMC value.

2. Spacer group composition: 
   - For straight spacers, CMC increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“
   - For branched spacers, CMC increases in the order: â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH

3. Branching: Increased branching in the spacer group tends to increase the CMC value.

4. Heteroatoms: Introduction of heteroatoms in the spacer group generally increases the CMC value.

5. Molecular connectivity: The study found that the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡) are important descriptors for predicting CMC values.

6. Charge distribution: The total charge on functional groups in the spacer affects the CMC, with more negatively charged groups generally leading to higher CMC values.

7. Spacer length: For star-shaped trimeric surfactants, the effect of spacer length on CMC is complex, with a potential maximum around six carbon atoms in each spacer chain.

These guidelines provide a framework for designing star-shaped trimeric surfactants with desired CMC values by manipulating their molecular structure. However, it's important to note that the model has limitations, particularly for spacer chains longer than six carbon atoms. Based on the information provided in the context, here are some key design guidelines for making surfactants with a desired Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is evident from the Klevens equation and other models that show an inverse relationship between chain length and CMC.

2. Hydrophilic head group: The size and nature of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups tend to increase CMC.

3. Branching: Branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase CMC compared to linear chains.

4. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the nature of the counterion impacts CMC. Generally, larger counterions lead to lower CMC values.

5. Temperature: CMC typically increases with temperature for ionic surfactants.

6. pH: Changes in pH can affect the CMC, especially for surfactants with ionizable groups.

7. Salinity: Increasing salinity generally decreases CMC for ionic surfactants due to charge screening effects.

8. Molecular descriptors: Various molecular descriptors like connectivity indices, dipole moment, and quantum chemical parameters correlate with CMC and can be optimized.

These guidelines are summarized from multiple sources in the context, including:

1. "Structure-based modeling of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of anionic surfactants in brine using intelligent methods" 
Published in Scientific Reports, 2023
DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-40466-1

2. "A review on progress in QSPR studies for surfactants"
Published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2010
DOI: 10.3390/ijms11031020

These papers provide detailed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models that relate molecular structure to CMC, which can be used to guide surfactant design. Based on the information provided in the paper, here are some key design guidelines for tuning the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of surfactants:

1. Tail length: Increasing the hydrocarbon tail length generally decreases the CMC. This follows the Stauff-Kleven's relationship, where CMC decreases exponentially with an increase in the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon tail.

2. Headgroup composition: Changing the headgroup can significantly affect the CMC. For example, nonionic surfactants typically have lower CMCs compared to ionic surfactants.

3. Counterions: For ionic surfactants, the choice of counterion can impact the CMC. The paper mentions that chloride and bromide counterions were among the most important factors for predicting CMC in ionic surfactants.

4. Branching: The structure of the hydrocarbon tail, including branching, can influence the CMC.

5. Polarity difference: The difference in polarity between the head and tail groups affects micelle formation. Greater differences generally lead to lower CMCs.

6. Functional groups: The presence and type of functional groups in the molecule, especially in the headgroup, can alter the CMC.

7. Stereochemistry: While not explicitly stated, the paper suggests that stereoisomers may have different CMCs, though this is not always captured by some prediction methods.

It's important to note that these guidelines are general trends, and the specific impact of each factor can vary depending on the overall molecular structure and composition.

This summary is based on the paper:

Title: "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning"
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868
Journal: Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation
Year: 2023 Based on the research in this field, there are several key design guidelines for tailoring surfactants to achieve a desired Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. Hydrophobic tail length: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. Longer hydrocarbon chains lead to stronger hydrophobic interactions and promote micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. Hydrophilic head group: The size and nature of the hydrophilic head group affects CMC. Larger head groups tend to increase CMC due to increased steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between molecules.

3. Counterion effects: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence CMC. Generally, larger counterions with lower charge density lead to lower CMC values.

4. Branching: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail typically increases CMC compared to linear chains of the same carbon number, due to less efficient packing.

5. Unsaturation: Adding double bonds to the hydrophobic tail usually increases CMC slightly compared to saturated chains.

6. Temperature sensitivity: Incorporating temperature-responsive groups can allow for CMC modulation with temperature changes.

7. pH sensitivity: Adding pH-sensitive groups can enable CMC control through pH adjustments.

8. Additives: The presence of salts or co-surfactants can significantly alter CMC values.

These guidelines are supported by the comprehensive review paper:

1. Increase the hydrophobic tail length

Let's start by increasing the hydrophobic tail length, as this is one of the most effective ways to lower CMC.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modified SMILES with a small cyclic structure in the tail and a modified head group has a predicted logCMC of -0.673 with an uncertainty of 0.412. This is slightly higher than our best result so far (-0.704), but still very good. Let's continue exploring modifications to find more promising structures. We can try introducing a small branching in the cyclic structure in the tail.
