Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon chain generally decreases the cmc. Branching, especially at the chain tips, can also lower the cmc by promoting dense surface packing and reducing surface energy.

2. **Headgroup Modifications**: The nature of the headgroup affects the solubility and the surface activity of the surfactant. For example, introducing more polar or ionic headgroups can enhance water solubility and influence the cmc.

3. **Fluorination**: Replacing hydrogen atoms in the hydrophobic tail with fluorine atoms can significantly lower the cmc due to the lower polarizability and greater hydrophobicity of fluorocarbon chains compared to hydrocarbon chains.

4. **Silicone Incorporation**: Using siloxane backbones can provide flexibility and lower surface tensions, which can also affect the cmc. The unique flexibility of siloxane chains allows for efficient packing at the interface.

5. **Branching and Bulkiness**: Introducing bulky or branched groups, such as in "hedgehog" surfactants, can help achieve low surface energies and influence the cmc by promoting dense packing of the surfactant molecules at the interface.

These guidelines are derived from the study of various surfactant structures and their effects on surface properties, as discussed in the article "Surfactants at the Design Limit" (DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336), published in Langmuir, 2015. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Here are some guidelines based on the provided context:

1. **Tail Length and Branching**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail or converting a linear alkyl chain into a branched one tends to increase the CMC. This is because shorter or branched tails reduce the hydrophobic effect, making micelle formation less favorable.

2. **Head Group Modifications**: Increasing the size or polarity of the hydrophilic head group also increases the CMC. Adding polar groups to the head group enhances its interaction with water, which can destabilize micelle formation.

3. **Removing Side Chains**: For more complex surfactants, removing side chains from the tail can increase the CMC, as it reduces the overall hydrophobic character of the molecule.

4. **Aromatic to Aliphatic Conversion**: Converting aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) to less polar aliphatic rings (e.g., cyclohexane) can decrease the CMC due to the reduced polarity of the head group.

These guidelines are derived from the study "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants" published in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2016, DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03164. The design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve modifying the molecular structure, particularly the functional groups and branching. Key points include:

1. **Counterions**: Use bromides as counterions to minimize the influence of other factors on the CMC value.
2. **Geometrical Structure**: The impact of modifying the geometrical structure on the CMC value should be consistent, regardless of the counterion type.
3. **Branches and Heteroatoms**: The inclusion of branches and heteroatoms in the spacer group affects the CMC. For example, the CMC increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight chains, and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched chains.
4. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: Use first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡) to predict the CMC. The values of these indices depend on the isomers and branching of the compound.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic head groups. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length and Structure**:
   - Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation.
   - Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance, which disrupts micelle formation.

2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**:
   - The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group significantly affect the CMC. Larger or more polar head groups can increase the CMC as they enhance solubility in water, making micelle formation less favorable.
   - Functional groups that increase the polarity or charge density of the head group can also increase the CMC.

3. **Temperature and Salinity Effects**:
   - The CMC is influenced by temperature in a non-linear manner. Initially, it decreases with increasing temperature until a minimum is reached, after which it increases with further temperature rise.
   - Adding salts to the solution generally decreases the CMC for anionic surfactants due to reduced electrostatic repulsion among head groups.

4. **Quantum Chemical Descriptors**:
   - Descriptors such as the Kier and Hall molecular connectivity index, dipole moment, and molecular volume are useful in predicting and designing surfactants with desired CMC values.

For detailed guidelines and models, refer to the following papers:
- "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structureâ€“property relationship approach," DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4661, Journal of Colloid Interface Science, 1997.
- "Estimation of critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants with QSPR approach," DOI: 10.1016/j.theochem.2004.04.003, Journal of Molecular Structure (Theochem), 2004.
- "Correlation of critical micelle concentration of sodium alkyl benzenesulfonates with molecular descriptors," DOI: 10.1007/BF02830706, Wuhan University Journal of Natural Sciences, 2006. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the tail length and headgroup composition. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature of the headgroup significantly affects the CMC. For instance, nonionic surfactants typically have lower CMCs compared to ionic surfactants. The steric and electronic properties of the headgroup can be tuned to achieve the desired CMC.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Surfactants with larger or more polarizable counterions tend to have lower CMCs.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the tail or adding functional groups can also affect the CMC. Branching usually increases the CMC due to steric hindrance, while functional groups can either increase or decrease the CMC depending on their nature and position.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including those using molecular dynamics simulations and empirical models.

For more detailed insights, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating various molecular characteristics, such as the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance the hydrophobic interactions that drive micelle formation.
2. **Head Group Area**: Modifying the size and type of the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to greater repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups can affect the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units can increase the hydrophilicity of the head group, thereby increasing the CMC.
4. **Temperature and Ionic Strength**: External factors such as temperature and ionic strength of the solution can also impact the CMC. Higher temperatures typically increase the CMC, while higher ionic strength can decrease it.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including the one by Boukelkal et al., which utilized quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodologies to predict the CMC of different surfactants based on their molecular descriptors.
