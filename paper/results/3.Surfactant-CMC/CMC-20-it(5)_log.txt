[32;1m[1;3mThought: To start, I need to research design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC). This will help guide the modifications I make to the initial SMILES.

Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: Design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), several structural modifications can be considered:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The length and branching of the hydrophobic tail significantly influence the cmc. Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the cmc, as longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation. Branching can also affect the cmc; for example, highly branched tails can lead to lower cmc values due to denser surface packing.

2. **Headgroup Type**: The nature of the headgroup (ionic, nonionic, zwitterionic) affects the cmc. Ionic surfactants typically have higher cmc values compared to nonionic surfactants due to electrostatic repulsion between headgroups.

3. **Degree of Fluorination**: For fluorocarbon surfactants, the extent and position of fluorination in the hydrophobic tail can lower the cmc. Perfluorinated surfactants, where all hydrogens are replaced by fluorine, tend to have lower cmc values due to weaker intermolecular forces and larger molecular volumes.

4. **Siloxane Backbone**: In silicone surfactants, the flexibility of the siloxane backbone and the presence of methyl groups can lower the cmc. The unique flexibility allows for efficient packing at the interface, reducing surface tension and promoting micelle formation.

5. **Chain Branching and Methylation**: For hydrocarbon surfactants, increasing the level of chain branching and methylation at the chain termini can lead to lower cmc values. This approach mimics the architecture of effective siloxane surfactants by promoting dense surface packing.

These guidelines are derived from the analysis of surfactant structure-function relationships and their impact on surface properties, particularly the cmc.

- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Tail Length**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. This is because shorter tails reduce the hydrophobic effect, making micelle formation less favorable.
2. **Head Group Size**: Increasing the size of the hydrophilic head group also increases the CMC. Larger head groups enhance the solubility of the surfactant in water, which raises the concentration needed for micelle formation.
3. **Branching**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC. Branched tails disrupt the packing within the micelle core, making micelle formation less favorable.
4. **Polar Groups**: Adding polar groups to the surfactant structure can increase the CMC. Polar groups enhance the hydrophilicity of the molecule, requiring a higher concentration for micelle formation.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants" published in *Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research* in 2016. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03121. To design a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc), the following guidelines can be considered based on the study:

1. **Geometrical Structure**: The cmc value is influenced by the molecular geometry, including the branching and the length of hydrocarbon chains. Increasing branching generally decreases the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1χν) and increases the second-order molecular connectivity index (2χ), which affects the cmc value.

2. **Functional Groups**: The type of functional groups in the spacer group significantly impacts the cmc. For example, the cmc value increases in the order: –CH2– < –NH– < –O– for straight-chain spacers, and –CH3 < –NH2 < –OH for branched spacers.

3. **Counterions**: Although the study focused on bromides as counterions, it suggests that the impact of modifying the geometrical structure on cmc should be consistent across different counterions.

4. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: Utilize molecular connectivity indices to predict and design the structure. The first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1χν) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2χ) are critical in determining the cmc.

These guidelines are derived from the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for the paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) values involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the molecule. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:

1. **Hydrophobic Chain Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles.
2. **Hydrophilic Head Group**: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group can significantly influence the CMC. For instance, larger or more polar head groups can increase the CMC due to enhanced solubility in water.
3. **Branching and Saturation**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail or using unsaturated chains can affect the CMC. Branched chains typically result in higher CMCs compared to linear chains of the same length.
4. **Functional Groups**: Adding functional groups such as hydroxyl, ether, or ester groups can modify the balance between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, thus altering the CMC.
5. **Temperature and Salinity**: The CMC is also influenced by external conditions such as temperature and salinity. For example, increasing temperature can initially decrease the CMC to a minimum point before it starts to increase again. Adding salts generally decreases the CMC for ionic surfactants.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including:

- "Structure‑based modeling of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of anionic surfactants in brine using intelligent methods," DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-40466-1, published in Scientific Reports, 2023.
- "Estimation of critical micelle concentration of anionic surfactants with QSPR approach," DOI: 10.1016/j.theochem.2004.04.003, published in J. Mol. Struct. (Thoechem), 2004.
- "Correlation of critical micelle concentration of sodium alkyl benzenesulfonates with molecular descriptors," DOI: 10.1007/BF02830812, published in Wuhan Univ. J. Nat. Sci., 2006.

These studies highlight the importance of molecular descriptors and external conditions in designing surfactants with desired CMC values. Designing a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves several considerations related to the molecular structure, particularly the tail length, headgroup composition, and counterions. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature and size of the headgroup significantly influence the CMC. For instance, larger or more complex headgroups can increase steric hindrance, potentially increasing the CMC. Conversely, smaller headgroups may decrease the CMC.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can affect the CMC. Surfactants with counterions that have a strong affinity for water (e.g., Cl⁻, Br⁻) typically have higher CMCs compared to those with less hydrophilic counterions.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the tail or adding functional groups can also impact the CMC. Branching generally increases the CMC due to reduced packing efficiency in the micelle core.

These guidelines are derived from various studies and models that analyze the relationship between surfactant structure and CMC. For a detailed discussion, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) values involves manipulating various molecular characteristics, including the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Here are some key guidelines:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance the hydrophobic interactions that drive micelle formation.
2. **Head Group Area**: Larger head groups can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance, which makes micelle formation less favorable.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions can significantly impact the CMC. For instance, adding ethylene oxide units can increase the hydrophilicity and thus the CMC.
4. **Temperature**: The CMC is also temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures typically leading to lower CMC values due to increased molecular motion and interaction.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including the one by Boukelkal et al., which utilized quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodologies to predict the CMC of different surfactants based on their molecular descriptors.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mBased on the guidelines derived from the research papers, here are the summarized design principles for optimizing the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC):

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC.
2. **Head Group Size**: Larger head groups can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance.
3. **Branching**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC.
4. **Functional Groups**: Adding polar or functional groups can increase the CMC.
5. **Degree of Fluorination**: Fluorination in the hydrophobic tail can lower the CMC.
6. **Siloxane Backbone**: Adding a siloxane backbone can lower the CMC.
7. **Counterions**: The type of counterion can affect the CMC for ionic surfactants.
