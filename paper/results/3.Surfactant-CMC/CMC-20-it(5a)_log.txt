Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: "design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC)"[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for making surfactants with a low Critical Micelle Concentration (cmc) involve several key considerations related to the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the headgroup. Here are the summarized guidelines:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**:
   - **Chain Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the cmc. This is described by the Klevens equation, which shows a logarithmic decrease in cmc with increasing chain length.
   - **Branching**: Introducing branching, especially at the chain termini, can lower the cmc. Branched chains, such as those in "hedgehog" surfactants, promote dense surface packing and reduce surface tension.
   - **Fluorination**: Replacing hydrogen atoms with fluorine in the hydrophobic tail can significantly lower the cmc due to the lower polarizability and greater hydrophobicity of fluorocarbon chains.

2. **Headgroup Structure**:
   - **Size and Charge**: The size and charge of the headgroup can influence the cmc. Larger or more highly charged headgroups can increase the cmc due to steric and electrostatic repulsion.
   - **Hydrophilicity**: The hydrophilicity of the headgroup should be balanced to ensure sufficient water solubility while minimizing the increase in cmc.

3. **Surface Packing**:
   - **Surface Excess (Î“)**: The surface excess, which is the amount of surfactant adsorbed at the interface, should be maximized to lower the cmc.
   - **Area per Molecule (Acmc)**: Reducing the area per molecule at the air-water interface can help achieve a lower cmc by promoting tighter packing of surfactant molecules.

4. **Chemical Nature**:
   - **Hydrocarbon vs. Fluorocarbon vs. Silicone**: Different classes of surfactants (hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon, silicone) have varying efficiencies in lowering surface tension and cmc. Fluorocarbon surfactants, for example, are particularly effective due to their unique properties.

These guidelines are based on the analysis of surfactant structure-function relationships and the impact of molecular modifications on surface properties.

**Reference**:
- Title: "Surfactants at the Design Limit"
- DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336
- Journal: Langmuir, 2015 Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Tail Length**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. This is because shorter tails reduce the hydrophobic effect, making micelle formation less favorable.
2. **Head Group Size**: Increasing the size of the hydrophilic head group also increases the CMC. Larger head groups enhance the solubility of the surfactant in water, thus requiring a higher concentration to form micelles.
3. **Branching**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail can increase the CMC. Branched tails disrupt the packing within the micelle core, making micelle formation less favorable.
4. **Polar Groups**: Adding polar groups to the surfactant can increase the CMC. Polar groups enhance the interaction with water, thus requiring a higher concentration for micelle formation.

These guidelines are supported by the study titled "New QSPR Models to Predict the Critical Micelle Concentration of Sugar-Based Surfactants" published in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 2016, DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.6b03114. To design a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), the following guidelines can be considered based on the study:

1. **Geometrical Structure**: The CMC is influenced by the molecular connectivity indices, which represent the structure of the molecule. Increasing branching in the molecule generally decreases the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1Ï‡Î½) and increases the second-order molecular connectivity index (2Ï‡).

2. **Functional Groups**: The type of spacer group significantly affects the CMC. For example, the CMC increases in the order: â€“CH2â€“ < â€“NHâ€“ < â€“Oâ€“ for straight chains, and â€“CH3 < â€“NH2 < â€“OH for branched chains.

3. **Counterions**: Although the study focused on bromides as counterions, the impact of modifying the geometrical structure on changes in the CMC value should be consistent across different counterions.

4. **Atomic Charges and Heteroatoms**: The inclusion of heteroatoms in the spacer group can affect the CMC. Semi-empirical calculations of atomic charges can help in understanding these effects.

These guidelines are derived from the paper titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," published in *Scientific Reports* in 2024. The DOI for the paper is https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58854-6. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) values involves manipulating molecular descriptors and functional groups. Here are some guidelines based on the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the number of carbon atoms in the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is supported by the relationship proposed by Klevens (1953).

2. **Molecular Connectivity Indices**: Parameters like the zeroth-order Kier and Hall molecular connectivity index (KH0) and the first-order Kier and Hall molecular connectivity index (KH1) are crucial. These indices correlate with molecular volume and surface area, affecting the CMC.

3. **Dipole Moment**: The total dipole moment (TDIP) of the surfactant molecule influences the CMC. A higher dipole moment can lead to a higher CMC.

4. **Hydrophilic Group Structure**: The relative number of carbon atoms in the hydrophilic moiety (head) and the diversity of head group structures (h-sum-RNC) are important. More diverse and larger hydrophilic groups can increase the CMC.

5. **Quantum Mechanical Descriptors**: Parameters such as the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) are also significant.

6. **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, pH, and salinity are external factors that can be adjusted to influence the CMC.

For detailed modeling and statistical analysis, refer to the paper titled "Structure-based modeling of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of anionic surfactants in brine using intelligent methods," DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-40466-1, published in Scientific Reports, 2023. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves several key considerations related to the molecular structure, particularly the tail length and headgroup composition:

1. **Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.

2. **Headgroup Composition**: The nature of the headgroup significantly affects the CMC. For instance, nonionic surfactants typically have lower CMCs compared to ionic surfactants. The steric and electronic properties of the headgroup, such as its cross-sectional area and polarity, also play crucial roles.

3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Surfactants with larger or more polarizable counterions tend to have lower CMCs.

4. **Branching and Functional Groups**: Introducing branching in the tail or adding functional groups can alter the CMC. Branching usually increases the CMC due to steric hindrance, while functional groups can either increase or decrease the CMC depending on their nature and position.

These guidelines are derived from various studies, including molecular dynamics simulations and empirical models, which have shown that the tail length and headgroup properties are the most critical factors in determining the CMC.

For more detailed insights, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. Designing surfactants with specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) values involves manipulating various molecular characteristics, including the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key guidelines include:

1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation at lower concentrations.
2. **Head Group Area**: Modifying the size and nature of the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more hydrophilic head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups such as oxyethylene units can affect the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) and, consequently, the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units can increase the hydrophilicity, potentially increasing the CMC.
4. **Temperature**: The CMC is also temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures generally leading to lower CMC values due to increased molecular motion and reduced hydration of the head groups.

These guidelines are supported by various studies, including the comprehensive research by Boukelkal et al., which utilized quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methodologies to predict the CMC of different surfactants based on their molecular descriptors.
