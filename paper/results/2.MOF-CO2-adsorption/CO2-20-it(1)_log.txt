Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: Design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Functional Group Introduction**: Introducing functional groups such as -OSO3H, -NO2, -OH, -NH2, and other polar groups like -N=C(R)-, -OH, -NH2, -N=N can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption. These groups improve the interaction between CO2 and the organic linkers, thereby increasing selectivity and stability.

2. **Pore Size and Shape Optimization**: Engineering the pore size and shape to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 molecules can enhance selective adsorption. Fine-tuning the pore aperture size is crucial for maximizing adsorption selectivity and capacity.

3. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Since CO2 is an acidic gas, designing MOFs with appropriate acidity-basicity properties can prevent structural ruptures and ensure stability. This involves careful selection of dopants and modifiers to maintain structural integrity and enhance CO2 capture.

4. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modifying the organic linker before or after MOF synthesis can improve CO2 capture efficiency. This includes changing the organic linker or adding functional groups that enhance CO2 interaction.

5. **Use of Dopants**: Incorporating dopants such as Ni, La, Cd, etc., can create better Lewis sites for CO2 capture, improving chemical stability and retention of structural integrity.

These guidelines are summarized from the paper titled "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation," published in *The Chemical Record* in 2022. The DOI for this paper is 10.1002/tcr.202100230. To enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity of the organic linker in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), several design strategies can be employed:

1. **Incorporation of Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functionalities such as aromatic amines can increase the interaction between the linker and CO2 molecules. For example, the use of 2-aminoterephthalate in CAU-1 enhances CO2 uptake due to the presence of polar amine groups.

2. **Heteroatomic Linkers**: Using linkers with heteroatoms like nitrogen can improve CO2 adsorption. For instance, Zn(btz) (btz = 5-bis(5-tetrazolo)-3-oxapentane) contains non-coordinating nitrogen atoms that interact with CO2.

3. **Alkylamine Functionalization**: Grafting alkylamines, such as N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen), onto the linker can significantly enhance CO2 uptake through chemisorptive processes. This approach has been demonstrated in mmen-Mg-IRMOF-74-II.

4. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing linkers that contribute to the hydrophobicity of the MOF structure can help in selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of water. An example is the use of hydrophobic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs).

5. **Defect Engineering**: Introducing defects in the linker can create additional active sites for CO2 adsorption. For example, missing linker defects in USTC-253-TFA have been shown to increase CO2 uptake capacity.

These strategies are summarized in the review article titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks," published in Science in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444).

- Year: 2013 To design an organic linker that adsorbs CO2 better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Increase the Density of Open Metal Sites**: By using smaller organic linkers, the density of open metal sites can be increased, which enhances the interaction with CO2 molecules. For example, replacing larger aromatic linkers with smaller aliphatic ones can achieve this.

2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing functional groups that have a high affinity for CO2, such as amines, can improve CO2 adsorption. These groups can form stronger interactions with CO2 molecules.

3. **Pore Size Optimization**: The pore size should be optimized to balance between accessibility and interaction strength. Smaller pores can increase the volumetric density of adsorbed CO2 but should not be too small to hinder gas diffusion.

4. **Metal Selection**: Different metals can be used to tune the binding strength of CO2. Metals like Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn have been shown to have varying binding energies with CO2, which can be leveraged to enhance adsorption.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metalâˆ’Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C in 2017. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb COâ‚‚ better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metals like lithium (Li) can significantly enhance the COâ‚‚ adsorption capacity. Li-decoration increases the electrostatic interaction between COâ‚‚ and the linker, leading to stronger physisorption.

2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing functional groups such as fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) can improve the interaction energy between COâ‚‚ and the linker. Fluorinated and chlorinated linkers exhibit favorable physisorption behavior due to their high electrostatic interactions.

3. **Hydrophobicity**: Designing hydrophobic linkers can be beneficial for COâ‚‚ capture in humid environments. Hydrophobic frameworks minimize competitive water adsorption, which is crucial for practical applications.

4. **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: Increasing the surface area and pore volume of the linkers can enhance the gas adsorption capacity. However, this should be balanced with maintaining the structural stability of the MOFs.

5. **Stability Considerations**: Ensuring the thermal, chemical, and kinetic stability of the linkers is essential. High energy gaps (E_g) and the absence of imaginary frequencies in vibrational analysis indicate stable geometries suitable for practical applications.

These guidelines are based on the study titled "Designing organic bridging linkers of metalâ€“organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry in 2024. DOI: 10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m
