[32;1m[1;3mThought: To begin, I need to research design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption. This will help me understand the structural features that enhance CO2 adsorption.

Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: Design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption.[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Functional Group Introduction**: Introducing functional groups such as -OSO3H, -NO2, -OH, -NH2, and other polar groups like -N=C(R)-, -N=N- can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption due to their ability to interact strongly with CO2 molecules.

2. **Pore Size Optimization**: Adjusting the pore size and window to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 can improve selective adsorption. This involves precise engineering of the pore structures to enhance the interaction potential between the adsorbent and CO2.

3. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Since CO2 is an acidic gas, designing MOFs with appropriate acidity-basicity properties can prevent structural ruptures and ensure stability. This can be achieved by doping with metals or modifying the organic linkers to balance the acidity.

4. **Stability Under Moist Conditions**: Functional groups that improve water stability should be considered, as flue gas often contains water vapor which can affect CO2 uptake.

5. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modifying the organic linkers either before or after MOF synthesis can enhance CO2 capture efficiency. This includes changing the organic linker or adding functional groups that improve CO2 interaction.

Reference:
- Title: "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation"
- DOI: 10.1002/tcr.202100230
- Journal: The Chemical Record, 2022 To enhance CO2 adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through modifications to the organic linker, several design guidelines can be followed:

1. **Incorporation of Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functionalities such as aromatic amines can increase the interaction between the linker and CO2 molecules. For example, the use of 2-aminoterephthalate in CAU-1 enhances CO2 uptake due to the polar nature of the amine group.

2. **Heteroatomic Functionalization**: Introducing heteroatoms like nitrogen into the linker can create additional sites for CO2 interaction. For instance, using linkers like 5-bis(5-tetrazolo)-3-oxapentane (btz) where non-coordinating nitrogen atoms are present can improve CO2 capture.

3. **Grafting Alkylamines**: Tethering alkylamines (primary, secondary, or tertiary) to the linker can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption through chemisorption. An example is the use of N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen) in mmen-Mg-IRMOF-74-II, which shows high CO2 uptake and selectivity.

4. **Defect Engineering**: Creating defects within the MOF structure can increase the number of active sites for CO2 adsorption. Missing linker defects, for example, have been shown to increase CO2 uptake capacity.

5. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Adjusting the hydrophobicity and pore size of the MOF can help in selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of water. Hydrophobic frameworks like ZIF-301 are designed to exclude water while capturing CO2.

These guidelines are summarized from the review article titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks" published in *Science* in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444).

- Year: 2013 To design an organic linker that adsorbs COâ‚‚ better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Increase the Density of Open Metal Sites**: By using smaller ligands, the density of open metal sites can be increased, which enhances the interaction between COâ‚‚ molecules and the framework.
2. **Use of Aliphatic Ligands**: Aliphatic ligands, which are generally cheaper and smaller than aromatic ligands, can be used to reduce the overall cost and increase the density of open metal sites.
3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing functional groups that can interact strongly with COâ‚‚, such as hydroxyl groups, can improve COâ‚‚ adsorption.
4. **Pore Size and Geometry**: Designing the framework with optimal pore size and geometry that matches the kinetic diameter of COâ‚‚ can enhance adsorption capacity.
5. **Metal Selection**: The choice of metal can influence the binding energy and interaction strength with COâ‚‚. Metals that form stronger bonds with COâ‚‚ should be preferred.

These guidelines are based on the study titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metalâˆ’Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," published in *The Journal of Physical Chemistry C* in 2017. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb COâ‚‚ more effectively, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metals such as lithium (Li) can significantly enhance the binding strength of COâ‚‚ due to increased electrostatic interactions and polarization energy components.

2. **Functionalization with Fluorine and Chlorine**: Incorporating fluorinated and chlorinated functional groups into the linkers can improve COâ‚‚ adsorption by increasing the electrostatic interactions and the quadrupole moment of COâ‚‚.

3. **Hydrophobic Nature**: Designing hydrophobic linkers can help in COâ‚‚ capture in humid environments by minimizing competitive water adsorption.

4. **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers can result in a higher surface area and pore volume, which enhances gas adsorption. However, this must be balanced with maintaining the stability of the MOFs.

5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Selecting linkers that contribute to the overall thermal and chemical stability of the MOFs is crucial for practical applications, especially in harsh conditions.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "Designing organic bridging linkers of metalâ€“organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry, 2024, DOI: 10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m
