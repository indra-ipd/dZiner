Action Input: Design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption.[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo enhance the CO2 adsorption capabilities of organic linkers in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), several design guidelines can be followed:

1. **Functional Group Introduction**: Incorporate functional groups such as -OSO3H, -NO2, -OH, -NH2, and other polar groups like -N=C(R)-, -N=N- into the organic linkers. These groups improve the selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases and enhance the stability of the framework.

2. **Pore Size Optimization**: Design the pore size and shape to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 molecules. This can be achieved by precise pore engineering to maximize adsorption selectivity and capacity.

3. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Ensure the MOF structure has an appropriate balance of acidity and basicity to stabilize CO2 within the framework. This helps in preventing structural ruptures and maintaining the integrity of the MOF under acidic conditions.

4. **Doping Strategies**: Explore the use of dopants such as Ni, La, Cd, etc., to create better Lewis sites for CO2 capture. This can enhance the chemical stability and retention of structural integrity.

5. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modify the organic linker before or after MOF synthesis to introduce desired functionalities and improve CO2 capture efficiency.

These guidelines are summarized from the paper titled "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation," published in *The Chemical Record* in 2022. The DOI for this paper is 10.1002/tcr.202100230. To enhance the CO2 adsorption capabilities of the organic linker in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), several design strategies can be employed:

1. **Incorporation of Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functional groups such as aromatic amines can increase the interaction between the linker and CO2 molecules. For example, the use of aromatic amines in CAU-1 has shown to improve CO2 capture.

2. **Heteroatomic Functionalization**: Introducing heteroatoms like nitrogen into the linker can create additional sites for CO2 interaction. For instance, using heteroatomic amines in Zn(btz) (btz = 5-bis(5-tetrazolo)-3-oxapentane) enhances CO2 uptake due to the presence of non-coordinating nitrogen atoms.

3. **Grafting Alkylamines**: Tethering alkylamines, either primary, secondary, or tertiary, to the linker can significantly improve CO2 adsorption. This approach has been demonstrated with mmen-Mg-IRMOF-74-II, where N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen) is grafted onto the linker, resulting in higher CO2 uptake.

4. **Defect Engineering**: Introducing defects in the MOF structure can create additional active sites for CO2 adsorption. For example, missing linker defects in USTC-253-TFA have been shown to increase CO2 uptake capacity by 167%.

5. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing the linker to have hydrophobic properties and optimizing pore metrics can help in selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of water. An example is the hydrophobic ZIF-301, which is effective in CO2 capture under humid conditions.

These strategies are summarized in the review article titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks" by Furukawa et al., published in Science in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444). To design an organic linker that adsorbs CO2 better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Increase the Density of Open Metal Sites**: By using smaller ligands, the density of open metal sites can be increased, which enhances the interaction with CO2 molecules.
2. **Use of Aliphatic Ligands**: Aliphatic ligands, which are generally cheaper and smaller than aromatic ligands, can be used to reduce the overall cost and increase the density of adsorption sites.
3. **Functional Groups**: Incorporate functional groups that can form strong interactions with CO2, such as hydroxyl groups, which can enhance the binding energetics.
4. **Pore Size Optimization**: Design the pore size to be optimal for CO2 adsorption, ensuring that the pores are not too large to avoid dilution of adsorption sites.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metalâˆ’Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," published in *The Journal of Physical Chemistry C* in 2017. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb COâ‚‚ more effectively, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metals such as lithium (Li) can significantly enhance the binding strength due to increased electrostatic interactions and polarization energy components.
2. **Functionalization**: Introducing functional groups like fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) can improve the physisorption behavior of COâ‚‚ on the linkers.
3. **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers can result in a higher surface area and pore volume, which enhances gas adsorption. However, this must be balanced with maintaining the stability of the MOFs.
4. **Hydrophobicity**: Designing hydrophobic linkers can help in COâ‚‚ capture in humid environments by minimizing competitive water adsorption.
5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Selecting linkers known for their high chemical and thermal stability is crucial for practical applications.

These guidelines are based on the study titled "Designing organic bridging linkers of metalâ€“organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry in 2024. DOI: 10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m
