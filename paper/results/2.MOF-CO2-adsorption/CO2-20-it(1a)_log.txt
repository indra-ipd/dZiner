[32;1m[1;3mTo begin, I need to research design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption.

Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: "design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption"[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 more effectively, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing functional groups such as -OSO3H, -NO2, -OH, -NH2, and other polar groups like -N=C(R)-, -N=N- can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption. These groups improve the interaction between CO2 and the organic linkers, thereby increasing selectivity and stability of the framework.

2. **Pore Size Optimization**: Engineering the pore size to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 molecules can enhance selective adsorption. Fine-tuning the pore aperture size and functionality is crucial for maximizing adsorption selectivity and capacity.

3. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Since CO2 is an acidic gas, the MOF structures should have an appropriate balance of acidity and basicity to ensure stability and prevent structural ruptures. This can be achieved through careful design and modification of the organic linkers.

4. **Doping Strategies**: Incorporating dopants such as Ni, La, or Cd can create better Lewis sites for CO2 capture, enhancing chemical stability and retention of structural integrity.

5. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modifying the organic linkers before or after the synthesis of MOFs can improve CO2 capture efficiency. This includes changing the organic linker before MOF preparation or employing organic modifiers like amino alcohols.

These guidelines are summarized from the paper titled "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation," DOI: 10.1002/tcr.202100230, published in The Chemical Record, 2022. To enhance the CO2 adsorption capabilities of the organic linker in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), several design strategies can be employed:

1. **Incorporation of Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functionalities such as aromatic amines can significantly improve CO2 uptake due to increased interactions between the CO2 molecules and the polar sites.

2. **Heteroatomic Incorporation**: Introducing heteroatoms like nitrogen into the linker structure can increase CO2 binding sites. For example, using linkers with non-coordinating nitrogen atoms allows these atoms to interact freely with CO2.

3. **Alkylamine Functionalization**: Grafting alkylamines (primary, secondary, or tertiary) onto the linker or metal sites can enhance CO2 adsorption through chemisorption, which typically leads to higher selectivity and uptake.

4. **Defect Engineering**: Creating defects within the MOF structure can expose more active sites for CO2 adsorption, thereby increasing the overall uptake capacity.

5. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing the linker to create hydrophobic environments and optimizing pore sizes can help in selectively capturing CO2 even in the presence of water.

These strategies are discussed in detail in the paper titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks" published in Science in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444). To design an organic linker that adsorbs COâ‚‚ better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Increase the Density of Open Metal Sites**: By using smaller organic linkers, the density of open metal sites can be increased, which enhances the interaction between COâ‚‚ and the adsorbent. For example, replacing larger aromatic linkers with smaller aliphatic ones can achieve this.

2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing functional groups that have a strong affinity for COâ‚‚ can improve adsorption. Functional groups such as amines, hydroxyls, and carboxylates can enhance COâ‚‚ binding through interactions like hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.

3. **Pore Size Optimization**: Adjusting the pore size to be comparable to the kinetic diameter of COâ‚‚ can improve adsorption by maximizing the interaction between the COâ‚‚ molecules and the framework.

4. **Ligand Rigidity**: Ensuring the ligand is rigid enough to maintain the structural integrity of the MOF while providing the necessary sites for COâ‚‚ adsorption.

These guidelines are based on the rational design approach discussed in the paper titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metalâˆ’Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C in 2017. To design organic linkers that adsorb COâ‚‚ more effectively, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metals such as lithium (Li) significantly enhances the binding strength due to increased electrostatic interactions and polarization energy components. This approach helps in achieving strong physisorption behavior.

2. **Functionalization with Fluorine and Chlorine**: Incorporating fluorinated and chlorinated functional groups into the linkers can improve COâ‚‚ adsorption. These groups increase the electrostatic interactions and enhance the overall affinity of the linkers for COâ‚‚ molecules.

3. **Increasing Surface Area**: Using linkers that contribute to a higher surface area in the resulting MOFs can improve gas adsorption capacity. However, care must be taken to maintain the stability of the MOFs, as larger linkers can sometimes compromise structural integrity.

4. **Hydrophobicity**: Designing hydrophobic linkers can be beneficial for COâ‚‚ capture in humid environments, as they minimize competitive water adsorption.

5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Selecting linkers that contribute to the high thermal and chemical stability of the MOFs is crucial for practical applications, especially under harsh conditions.

6. **Tuning Pore Size and Volume**: Modifying the linkers to create MOFs with optimal pore size and volume can enhance the storage and capture efficiency of COâ‚‚.

These guidelines are based on the study "Designing organic bridging linkers of metalâ€“organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry, 2024. DOI: 10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mBased on the guidelines from the research papers, I will make the following changes to the initial SMILES to enhance CO2 adsorption:

1. **Incorporate functional groups**: Add functional groups that can interact with CO2, such as amines or hydroxyl groups. This can increase the affinity of the material for CO2.

2. **Increase surface area**: Use linkers that can increase the surface area of the material, providing more sites for CO2 adsorption.

3. **Optimize pore size**: Ensure that the pore size is optimal for CO2 adsorption, which can be achieved by modifying the structure of the material.

4. **Use of metals**: Consider using metals that can enhance the binding of CO2, such as lithium.

5. **Incorporate heteroatoms**: Use heteroatoms in the structure to increase the interaction with CO2 molecules.

6. **Stability**: Ensure that the structure is stable and can withstand harsh conditions.

With these guidelines in mind, I will now proceed to make changes to the initial SMILES to improve its CO2 adsorption properties. I will then evaluate the new structure to ensure that it meets the desired criteria. Let's begin by evaluating the initial structure.

Once the evaluation is complete, I will make the necessary changes to improve the structure's CO2 adsorption properties. The goal is to achieve a balance between high adsorption capacity and stability. This will involve optimizing the structure to ensure that it can effectively capture and store CO2 while maintaining its integrity. 

I will then evaluate the new structure to ensure that it meets the desired criteria. This process may involve multiple iterations to achieve the optimal design. The final structure should have a high adsorption capacity, stability, and be cost-effective for practical applications.
