[32;1m[1;3mTo begin, I need to research design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption. This will help inform the modifications I make to the initial SMILES structure.

Action: lookup_papers
Action Input: Design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mTo enhance the CO2 adsorption capabilities of organic linkers in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), several design guidelines can be followed:

1. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing various functional groups such as sulfonate (OSO3H), nitro (NO2), hydroxyl (OH), and amino (NH2) groups can significantly improve CO2 adsorption. These groups enhance the interaction between CO2 and the organic linkers due to their polar nature.

2. **Acidity-Basicity Balance**: Since CO2 is an acidic gas, the MOF design must ensure an appropriate balance between acidity and basicity to prevent structural ruptures and maintain stability.

3. **Pore Size and Shape Optimization**: Fine-tuning the pore size and shape to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 can enhance selective adsorption. This involves designing the pore structures to provide maximum surface area and appropriate adsorption sites.

4. **Doping with Metals**: Introducing dopants such as Ni, La, and Cd can create better Lewis sites for CO2 capture, enhancing the overall adsorption capacity and stability of the MOF structure.

5. **Pre-synthetic and Post-synthetic Modifications**: Modifying the organic linker either before or after the MOF synthesis can improve CO2 capture efficiency. This includes changing the organic linker or employing organic modifiers like amino alcohols.

These guidelines are based on the insights provided in the paper titled "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation," published in *The Chemical Record* in 2022. The DOI for this paper is 10.1002/tcr.202100230. To design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 more effectively, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Incorporating Polar Functional Groups**: Adding polar functional groups such as aromatic amines can enhance CO2 adsorption due to increased interactions between the CO2 molecules and the polar sites on the linker.
   
2. **Heteroatomic Functionalization**: Using heteroatoms like nitrogen in the linker structure can provide additional sites for CO2 interaction. For example, incorporating tetrazole groups where non-coordinating nitrogen atoms are free to interact with CO2.

3. **Grafting Alkylamines**: Tethering alkylamines, such as N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen), to the linker can significantly increase CO2 uptake through chemisorption, which is particularly effective at low pressures relevant to carbon capture from flue gas.

4. **Creating Defects**: Introducing defects in the linker can increase the number of active sites available for CO2 adsorption.

5. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing the linker to have hydrophobic properties and appropriate pore sizes can help in selectively capturing CO2 in the presence of water.

These strategies are discussed in the review article titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks" published in *Science* in 2013 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444). Another relevant review is "Carbon dioxide capture in metal-organic frameworks" published in *Chemical Reviews* in 2012 (DOI: 10.1021/cr2003272). To design an organic linker that adsorbs CO2 better, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Increase Density of Open Metal Sites**: Utilize smaller ligands to enhance the density of open metal sites, which interact strongly with CO2 molecules.
2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introduce functional groups that can form stronger interactions with CO2, such as amines or hydroxyl groups.
3. **Pore Size Optimization**: Ensure the pore size is optimal for CO2 adsorption, avoiding too large pores that dilute the interaction sites.
4. **Ligand Rigidity**: Use rigid ligands to maintain structural integrity and proper orientation of functional groups for CO2 interaction.
5. **Tunable Metal Selection**: Choose metals that enhance the binding energetics with CO2, such as Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, or Zn.

These guidelines are based on the rational design approach discussed in the paper titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metalâˆ’Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C in 2017. The DOI for this paper is 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb COâ‚‚ more effectively, the following guidelines can be considered:

1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metal atoms, such as lithium (Li), can significantly enhance COâ‚‚ adsorption. This is due to the high electrostatic interaction between COâ‚‚ and the metal atoms.

2. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing halogen groups, such as fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl), to the organic linkers can improve their affinity for COâ‚‚. For instance, linkers like 3-fluoro-1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (FBDC) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (TFBDC) have shown favorable physisorption behavior.

3. **Linker Length and Surface Area**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers can result in a higher surface area, which enhances gas adsorption. However, this must be balanced with the stability of the MOFs, as longer linkers can sometimes compromise structural integrity.

4. **Hydrophobicity**: For practical applications, especially in humid environments, using hydrophobic linkers can minimize competitive water adsorption, thus improving COâ‚‚ capture efficiency.

5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Selecting linkers that contribute to the overall thermal and chemical stability of the MOFs is crucial for maintaining performance under various conditions.

These guidelines are based on the findings from the study titled "Designing organic bridging linkers of metalâ€“organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry in 2024. The DOI for this paper is https://doi.org/10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mBased on the design guidelines for enhancing CO2 adsorption in organic linkers, I will summarize the key strategies:

1. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing polar functional groups such as sulfonate, nitro, hydroxyl, and amino groups can enhance CO2 interactions (DOI: 10.1002/tcr.202100230).
2. **Heteroatomic Functionalization**: Incorporating nitrogen-containing groups like tetrazole can provide additional CO2 interaction sites (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444).
3. **Grafting Alkylamines**: Adding alkylamines can increase CO2 uptake through chemisorption (DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444).
4. **Pore Size Optimization**: Ensuring optimal pore size for CO2 adsorption is crucial (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363).
5. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating linkers with metals like lithium can enhance CO2 adsorption (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1039/d4nj01197j).

Next, I will evaluate the initial SMILES for its CO2 adsorption and validity.
