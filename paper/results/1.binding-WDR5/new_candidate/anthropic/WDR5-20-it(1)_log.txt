Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance binding affinity against the WDR5 target involve several key strategies:

1. **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Introducing aromatic rings that can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, as seen with the aromatic ring A in compound 30, which interacts with sidechains of Phe133, Phe149, and Tyr191 through Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with Tyr191.

2. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Modifying substituents in solvent-exposed regions to improve binding affinity without disrupting the core interactions. For example, adding a 4-aminobutanamido group to compound 30 enhanced binding affinity significantly.

3. **Linker Optimization**: Using rationally designed linkers to attach functional groups, such as biotin, to solvent-exposed regions to maintain or improve binding affinity while enabling additional functionalities like chemoprecipitation.

4. **Docking Studies**: Utilizing molecular docking to predict and confirm the binding orientation and interactions of modified compounds with WDR5, ensuring that modifications do not interfere with critical binding interactions.

These strategies were effectively applied in the design and synthesis of compounds targeting WDR5, as detailed in the study "Design, synthesis, and initial evaluation of affinity-based small molecular probe for detection of WDR5," published in Bioorganic Chemistry, 2018.
