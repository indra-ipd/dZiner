[32;1m[1;3mThought: To start this process, I need to research the design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5. This will give me the necessary chemical intuition to make informed modifications to the given SMILES.

Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance binding affinity against the WDR5 target involve several strategies:

1. **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Introducing aromatic rings that can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, as seen with the aromatic ring A in compound 30, which interacts with sidechains of Phe133, Phe149, and Tyr191, forming Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with Tyr191.

2. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Modifying substituents at positions that are solvent-exposed to avoid steric clashes and maintain or enhance binding affinity. For example, the 4-aminobutanamido group in compound 42 improved binding affinity by being positioned in a solvent-exposed region.

3. **Linker Optimization**: Using rational linkers to connect functional groups or tags (e.g., biotin) to the core scaffold without significantly affecting binding affinity. This was demonstrated by the introduction of a long linker in LC001, which maintained high binding affinity.

4. **Docking Studies**: Utilizing molecular docking to predict and confirm the binding orientation and interactions of the modified compounds with WDR5, ensuring that modifications do not disrupt critical interactions.

These strategies are based on the study titled "Design, synthesis, and initial evaluation of affinity-based small molecular probe for detection of WDR5," published in Bioorganic Chemistry in 2018. The DOI for this paper is 10.1016/j.bioorg.2017.11.018.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modification of adding a fluorine atom to the naphthyl group while keeping the isopropyl group on the piperazine ring has further improved the binding affinity, with the docking score decreasing from -8.7 to -8.8. This is our best result so far. The fluorine atom may be providing additional favorable interactions or improving the electron distribution in the naphthyl group.

Observation: [38;5;200m[1;3m-8.7[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modification of replacing the methyl group with an ethyl group on the piperazine ring slightly decreased the binding affinity (from -8.9 to -8.7). This suggests that the additional carbon in the ethyl group might be causing some steric hindrance or unfavorable interactions. Our best binding affinity is still -8.9 with the structure CN1CCN(C2=C(NC(C3=CC=C(Cl)C4=CC=CC=C43)=O)C=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C(C)C1.
