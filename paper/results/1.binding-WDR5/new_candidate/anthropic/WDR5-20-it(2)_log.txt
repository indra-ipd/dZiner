Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance binding affinity against the WDR5 target involve several strategies:

1. **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Introducing aromatic rings that can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, as seen with the aromatic ring A in compound 30, which interacts with sidechains of Phe133, Phe149, and Tyr191, forming Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with Tyr191.

2. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Modifying substituents at positions that are solvent-exposed to improve binding affinity without disrupting the core interactions. For example, adding a 4-aminobutanamido group to compound 30 enhanced binding affinity significantly.

3. **Linker Optimization**: Using rational linkers to attach functional groups or tags (e.g., biotin) to the molecule, ensuring that these modifications do not interfere with the binding core but rather enhance the overall binding affinity.

4. **Docking Studies**: Performing molecular docking studies to predict and confirm the binding orientation and interactions of the modified compounds with WDR5, ensuring that new modifications maintain or improve binding affinity.

These guidelines are based on the study titled "Design, synthesis, and initial evaluation of affinity-based small molecular probe for detection of WDR5," published in Bioorganic Chemistry in 2018. The DOI for this paper is 10.1016/j.bioorg.2017.11.018.[0m

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modified SMILES with the added methoxy group on the piperazine ring has a docking score of -7.9, which is worse than our previous best result of -9.0. This suggests that the addition of the methoxy group did not improve binding affinity as we hoped, and it also decreased the drug-likeness of the molecule. Let's revert to our previous best structure (docking score -9.0) and try a different modification.

For the next modification, let's try to enhance the electronic properties by adding a small polar group (hydroxyl) to the ethyl substituent on the phenyl ring. This might improve binding affinity through additional hydrogen bonding while potentially improving solubility and drug-like properties.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modified SMILES with the added hydroxyl group on the ethyl substituent is valid, with an SA score of 3.33, QED score of 0.29, and molecular weight of 590.02 g/mol. The QED score has decreased slightly, and the SA score has increased, which might indicate a reduction in drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility. However, let's check its binding affinity against WDR5 to see if there's an improvement in that aspect.

Observation: [38;5;200m[1;3m-8.5[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modified SMILES with the added hydroxyl group on the ethyl substituent has a docking score of -8.5, which is better than many of our previous attempts but not as good as our best result of -9.0. This suggests that the hydroxyl group provides some benefit to binding affinity, but not enough to surpass our best candidate. The decrease in QED score also indicates a potential trade-off between binding affinity and drug-likeness. 

At this point, we have explored several modifications and have generated 20 new SMILES candidates. Our best performing molecule so far has a docking score of -9.0. Let's summarize our findings and provide the final answer in the required JSON format.
