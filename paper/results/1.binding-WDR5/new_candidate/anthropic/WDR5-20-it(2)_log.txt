Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance binding affinity against the WDR5 target involve several strategies:

1. **Introduction of Aromatic Rings**: Adding aromatic rings can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, forming Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with residues like Tyr191. This was demonstrated with the introduction of an aromatic ring A in compound 30, which improved binding affinity.

2. **Substituent Modifications**: Modifying substituents at specific positions can enhance binding affinity. For example, adding a 4-aminobutanamido group to compound 30 resulted in compound 42, which showed a significant improvement in binding affinity (IC50 from 88.7 nM to 7.6 nM).

3. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Designing modifications that are solvent-exposed can help in maintaining or improving binding affinity without steric hindrance. This was shown in the docking studies where the biotin group in LC001 was solvent-exposed, maintaining the binding affinity.

4. **Linker Optimization**: Introducing rational linkers can further improve binding affinity. For instance, the introduction of a long linker in LD055 improved the binding affinity compared to compound 30.

These strategies are based on the study titled "Design, synthesis, and initial evaluation of affinity-based small molecular probe for detection of WDR5," published in Bioorganic Chemistry in 2018. The DOI for this paper is 10.1016/j.bioorg.2017.11.018.[0m
