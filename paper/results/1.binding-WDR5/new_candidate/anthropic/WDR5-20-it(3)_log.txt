Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance binding affinity against the WDR5 target involve several strategies:

1. **Introduction of Aromatic Rings**: Adding aromatic rings can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, forming Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with residues like Tyr191. This was demonstrated with the modification of compound 30, where an aromatic ring A was introduced to enhance binding affinity.

2. **Substituent Groups**: Modifying substituent groups, such as adding a 4-aminobutanamido group, can further improve binding affinity. For example, the modification of compound 30 to compound 42 resulted in an improved IC50 value from 88.7 nM to 7.6 nM.

3. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Designing modifications that target solvent-exposed regions can maintain or enhance binding affinity without disrupting the core interactions. This approach was used to attach a biotin tag to compound 30, resulting in the probe LC001, which maintained high binding affinity.

4. **Linker Length and Flexibility**: Introducing a rational long linker can improve binding affinity by allowing better accommodation within the binding site. This was evident in the design of LD055, which showed an improved IC50 value of 33.8 nM compared to compound 30.

These strategies are based on the study titled "Design, synthesis, and initial evaluation of affinity-based small molecular probe for detection of WDR5," published in Bioorganic Chemistry in 2018. The DOI for this paper is 10.1016/j.bioorg.2017.11.018.[0m
