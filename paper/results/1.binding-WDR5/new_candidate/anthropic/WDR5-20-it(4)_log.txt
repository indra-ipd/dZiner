Action Input: design guidelines for molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5
[0m
Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for scaffold hopping to enhance the binding affinity of a molecule against the WDR5 target involve several strategies:

1. **Introduction of Aromatic Rings**: Adding aromatic rings can occupy the hydrophobic groove of WDR5, forming Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with residues like Tyr191. This was demonstrated with compound 30, where an aromatic ring A was introduced to enhance binding affinity.

2. **Substituent Modifications**: Modifying substituent groups, such as adding a 4-aminobutanamido group, can further enhance binding affinity. For example, modifying compound 30 to compound 42 improved the IC50 value from 88.7 nM to 7.6 nM.

3. **Solvent-Exposed Regions**: Designing modifications that place substituent groups in solvent-exposed regions can maintain or improve binding affinity without steric hindrance. This approach was used to develop the biotinylated probe LC001, which maintained high binding affinity.

4. **Linker Optimization**: Introducing rational linkers that do not interfere with the binding site but enhance overall binding affinity. For instance, the introduction of a long linker in LD055 improved the IC50 value to 33.8 nM.

These strategies collectively help in designing molecules with higher binding affinity against WDR5 by optimizing interactions within the binding site and ensuring solvent compatibility.

Observation: [38;5;200m[1;3m-8.2[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The modified SMILES with the pyridine ring shows a docking score of -8.2, which is lower than our best score of -9.2. This suggests that the original benzene ring might be more favorable for binding to WDR5 than the pyridine ring. Let's revert to the structure with the docking score of -9.2 and try a different modification.

Let's try to optimize the piperidine ring by replacing it with a morpholine ring, which might provide additional hydrogen bonding opportunities while maintaining a similar shape.

We've now tried several modifications, but none have surpassed our best score of -9.2. Let's summarize our findings and report the results.
